  boconggo “coloured,” “colourful” (boco “colour”); 
  erdemungge “virtuous,” “talented,” “moral” (erdemu “capability,” “virtue,” power”); 
  gosingga “beloved,” “compassionate,” “cherished,” “loving,” “merciful” (gosin “mercy,” “pity,” “love”); 
  horonggo, horonggu “powerful,” “majestic,” “possessing great authority” (horon “power,” “majesty,” “authority”); 
  moringga “pertaining to the horse,” “mounted;” “horseman,” “rider” (morin “horse”). 
  The final -n of a stem is deleted before the addition of the suffix -ngga/-ngge/ -nggo. 

Plurals: |
  In general, only human nouns in Manchu have plural fonns; such forms as morisa 'horses' must be considered exceptional. The Manchu plural is strictly speaking a sort of collective, and is not used with numerals. The plural morpheme has several variants: -ri, -si, -ta, (-te), -sa (-se, -so). Roots ending in -n drop the -n before adding the suffix.

  -ri
  This suffix occurs with only two words:
  mafa, mafari — 'ancestor, grandfather'
  mama, mamri — 'female ancestor, grandmother'.

  -si
  This suffix also occurs with only a limited number of nouns of which the ones listed below are the most important:
  aha, ahasi — 'slave, servant'
  haha, hahasi — 'man'
  hehe, hehesi — 'woman'
  omolo, omosi — 'grandchild'
  asihan, asihasi — 'servant'
  hojihon, hojihosi — 'son-in-law'

  -ta, -te
  Back vocalic words take -ta. Front vocalic words take -te:
  ahvn, ahvta — 'elder brother'
  sargan,  sargata — 'wife'
  ama, amata — 'father'
  deo, deote — 'younger brother'
  eigen, eigete — 'husband'
  eme, emete — 'mother'
  eshen, eshete — 'father's younger brother' 
  efu, efute — 'wife's older brother' 
  ejen, ejete — 'lord''
  meye, meyete — 'husband of younger sister'

  -sa, -se, -so
  This suffix may sometimes be found written seperately from the word with which it belongs.
  Back vocalic words take -sa:
  amban, ambasa — 'official'
  bayan, bayasa — 'rich man' 
  faksi, faksisa — 'craftsman'
  fujin, fujisa — 'lady'
  hafan, hafasa — 'lower official'

  nikan, nikasa — 'Chinese'
  sakda, sakdasa — 'old man'
  xabi, xabisa — 'student'
  taiji, taijisa — 'prince' 

  Front vocalic words take -se:
  guce, gucuse — 'friend, comrade'
  jui, juse — 'son, child'
  mergen, mergese — 'wise man'

  Round vocalic words take -sa:
  monggo, monggoso — 'Mongol'
  solho, solhoso — 'Korean'

  Sometimes sa, se are written seperately and joined with one of the case particles.
  baturu sei — 'of the three heroes'
  ahasi sabe — 'the slaves (acc.)' 
  In the last example notice that the plura morpheme occurs twice in two different forms.

Conditional converb: |
  -qi
  The conditional-temporal converb is formed by adding the invariable suffix -qi to the verbal stem; this converb shows the condition under which an action occurs or the time when it occurs. It may usually be translated by 'if or 'when'.

  si buceqi — 'when you die' or 'if you die'
  ice bade hecen boo araqi, gurun jobombi kai —
  'If we build a wall and houses in a new place, the country will suffer.'
  bi geneqi — 'if l go' or 'when I go'

  The conditional-temporal converb is used with certain auxiliary verbs.

  si yali be jeqi ombi — 'you may eat meat'
  jeqi etembi —'can eat'
  jeqi bahambi — 'can eat'
  jeqi mutembi — 'can eat'
  jeqi aqambi — 'is fitting to eat, should eat'

  The conditional-temporal forms of a few verbs are used idiomatically.

  donjiqi is used to introduce hearsay expressions.

  Donjiqi si te Manju bithe taqimbi sembi. — 
  'I have heard that you're studying Manchu now'

  oqi is used to set off the subject or topic of a sentence.
  Hadai guruni wan han oqi, uyun hvlha be waha sembi.
  'As for King Wan of Hada, they say he killed the nine robbers.'

Concessive converb: |
  The concessive converb is formed by adding the invariable suffix -qibe to the verbal stem. It means 'even though ... ' or 'although'
  si erde bedereqibe — 'even though you return early'

Desiderative: |
  -qina
  The desiderative/second optative is formed by adding the invariable suffix -qina to the stem of the verb:
  afaqina, oqina, gvniqina
  This form expresses a desire on the part of the speaker that an action be performed either by the person he is speaking to (or more rarely by some other person). It is very similar in meaning to the -kini form; it is not used in the permissive sense however.

  nure be omire be nakaqina — 'I hope he will stop drinking wine'
  si te geneqina — 'I want you to go right now'.

Perfect converb: |
  -fi, -pi, -mpi
  The perfect converb is formed by attaching the invariable suffix -fi to the verb stem.
  tuwafi 'having looked'
  bucefi 'having died'

  A small number of verbs take -pi or -mpi. The occurrence of these variants is lexical, and the same verb may sometimes have -pi and sometimes -fi. The -pi suffix seems to be an archaic form of -fi. Some common verbs taking -pi and -mpi are listed below:
  sa-, sampi — 'stretch'
  juwa-, juwampi — 'open the mouth'
  we-, wempi — 'melt'
  hvwaliya-, hvwaliyapi — 'harmonize'
  colgoro-, colgoropi — 'surpass'
  yu-, yumpi — 'incline to'

  desere-, deserepi — 'overflow'
  dule-, dulepi — 'pass'
  gvwaliya-, gvwaliyapi — 'change'
  suma-, sumapi (sumafi) — 'spread'

  The perfect converb shows that one action has been completed before the next begins.

  songgoro be nakafi, emgeri hengkilehe —
  'Having stopped crying, he kowtowed once.'

  yali be sindafi, mukei dolo fekuhe —
  'He put down the meat and jumped into the water.

Perfect participle: |
  -ha, -he, -ho
  The perfect participle is formeded with the variable suffix -ha, -he, -ho.

  ha occurs with back vocalic roots,
  he occurs with front vocalic words,
  ho occurs with roots containing all o's

  Roots containing only i or u may take either -ha or -he; the occurrence is lexical, although forms with -ha predominate. 

  -ka, -ke, -ko
  There is one class of verbs that have the variant suffix -ka, -ke, -ko. Some of the chief ones are listed below:
  
  algi- — 'be famous'
  exu- — 'hold in the mouth'
  bisa- — 'overflow'
  dosi- — 'enter'

  -n
  A group of verbs with a final -n root have an irregular formation:
  jon-, jombi — 'to mention' — jongko
  wen-, wembi — 'to melt' — wengke
  ban-, bambi — 'to be lazy'— bangka

  Like the imperfect participle, the perfect participle is nominal insofar as it may occur as an object, attribute, or predicate, but verbal insofar as it may have an object.

  as object

  jugvn tosoho be sabufi — 'having seen the blocking of the road'
  gisurehe be donjifi — 'having heard what was said'
  gashvha be efulerakv — 'will not betray what was sworn'

  as attribute

  mini gisurehe gisun — 'the words I said'
  foloho enggemu hadala — 'carved saddle and bridle'
  jugvn de tuheke jaka — 'a thing lost on the road'

  as predicate

  abka de hengkileme bithe deijihe — 'kowtowing to heaven, he burnt the book'
  geli hoton de dosika — 'again he entered the city'
  wargi alin de ambula sebjelehe — 'we greatly enjoyed ourselves at the Western hills'

  with particles and postpositions

  dain cooha tucike de — 'when the enemy soldiers left'
  jihe de — 'when he came'
  hoton i cooha amasi bederehe manggi — 'after the soldiers of the city had retreated' 

Perfect tense: |
  The form in -habi/-hebi/-hobi and -ngkabi/-ngkebi/-ngkobi.
  This form is used to indicate the past indefinite. As for the origin of
  this form, it seems to originate from two components, the suffix of
  the perfect participle -ha/-he/-ho, -ngka/-ngke/-ngko and the copula
  bi: -habi/-hebi/-hobi < -ha/-he/-ho + bi. 

Stative converb: |
  -hai, hei, hoi
  The stative converb is formed by adding the instrumental particle -i to the perfect participle:
  jihei, afahai, sorokoi

  The stative converb shows that the action of the verb continues while another action is performed.
  songgohoi genehe — 'he went weeping'
  aliyahai sadahabi — 'he become tired while waiting'

Negative Participle Forms: |
  -rakv
  The Manchu verb has only two negative forms; both are contractions of the participles and the negative particle akv 'without, not'. The ending of the imperfect participle -ra, -re, -ro fuses with the negative particle to give the form -rakv.

  bi sinde akdarakv — 'I don't trust you'.
  ainu jiderakv — 'why don't you come?'

  The negative imperfect participle of sambi 'to know' usually appears as sarkv. 

  -hakv, hekv, hokv
  The negative particle fuses with the ending of the perfect participle to give the following forms.

  ha + akv > hakv (kakv)
  he + akv > hekv (kekv)
  ho + akv > hokv (kokv)

  jihekv — 'he didn't come'
  umai jaka jekekv — 'he didn't eat anything at all'
  sorokokv — 'it didn't turn yellow' 

Substantive Forms of Participles: |
  when a participial form is used as a subject it generally takes the suffix -ngge:
  arki nure omirengge, ai sain — 'how is the drinking of liquor and wine good?'

Desiderative: |
  -ki
  The desiderative is formed by adding the invariable suffix -ki to the stem of the verb:
  afaki, songgoki, joki

  The desiderative shows a desire or intention to perform an action on the part of the speaker.
  soorin be bahaki — 'I want to attain the throne'
  bi neneme geneki — 'I shall go first'.
  suweni gisun be donjiki — 'I'll listen to what you have to say.'

  -ki sembi
  -ki sembi expresses the idea of 'to want to ... '

Optative: |
  -kini
  The optative is formed by adding the invariable suffix -kini to the verb stem:
  banjikini, atakini, jekini

  The optative shows a strong desire on the part of the speaker that some action be performed. It generally refers to the third person.
  bi buceci mini sunja jui banjikini — 'If I die, I hope my five children will live!'

  It may be used as a polite imperative:
  tubade dedukini — 'please stay there' 

  It is also used to express permission; in this usage if is especially common to have the optative form preceded by a conditional form of the same verb.
  dosici dosikini — 'he may enter; lit., if he enters, let him enter'.

Aorist: |
  -mbi
  The most important of these periphrastic forms with the bimbi consists of the imperfect converb plus bi. This form is usually contracted to -mbi; it is the action form used in all dictionaries of Manchu. It is a general finite imperfect form. It may refer to future time:
  cimari bi genembi — 'I'll go tomorrow'

  It may be used to make general factual statements:
  aisin na ci tucimbi — 'gold comes from the earth'
  si sambio — 'do you know?'

  It may show a progressive action:
  alin ci muke eyembi — 'Water is flowing from the mountain'
  tuwame bi — 'He is watching'.
  sefu i emgi nure omicame bi — 'He was (is) drinking wine with his teacher'.

Durative hypothetical imperfect tense: |
  -me + bihe
  this form has several uses. It may be a habitual past.
  Sahaliyan ula yaya aniya omxon biya i tofohon orin de juhe jafambiheo —
  'On the Sahaliyan River ice would form every year on the fifteenth or twentieth of the eleventh month'.

Durative simultaneous converb: |
  -me + bime
  emu derei toombime emu derei songgome —
  'on the one hand cursing, on the other hand weeping'

Imperfect converb: |
  The imperfect converb is formed by adding the invariable suffix -me to the verb stem. Converbs are dependent forms, and do not occur finally in a complete sentence. Clauses ending in converbs usually set the scene for the action of the main clause in the sentence or simply show a sequence of actions that occur before or concurrently with the action of the main verb.
  The imperfect converb shows an action that is going on at the same time as the action of the main verb .
  morin be dabkime, beri daraha — 'whipping up his horse, he drew his bow.'
  burulame genere niyalma be ambula waha — 'They killed many men who were fleeing.'
  Manju gisun getuken bime dacun. — 'The Manchu language is clear and to the point.'

  The imperfect converb is also used to show purpose.

  han de acame yabu. — 'go to meet the king'
  Yehei gurun be dailame genere de — 'when they were going to attack the country of Yehe'

  The imperfect converb is used with auxiliary verbs:
  nure omime muterakv — 'can't drink wine'
  yabume bahanarakv — 'not able to go'
  agame deribuhe — 'began to rain'

  Both direct and indirect speech are introduced by imperfect converbial forms of verbs meaning to speak, think, ask, answer, etc. Common verbs of this type are
  hendu- — 'speak'
  se- — 'say'
  ala- — 'report'
  ara- — 'write'
  hula- — 'read'
  jasi- — 'send a letter'
  gvni- — 'think'
  fonji- — 'ask'
  jabu- — 'answer'
  tere duin gucu jabume, beile si buceci, be simbe dahame bucembi seme henduhe —

  A number of imperfect converbial forms have idiomatic uses.
  seme
  Both direct and indirect quotations are closed with seme.

  gajime jimbi seme donjifi — 'having heard that he would bring him'
  moo saci seme hulame — 'shouting, "cut down the tree'

  der seme — 'greatly'
  fik seme — 'densely'

  seme is also found in connection with modal adverbs:

  ninggureme 'on top of'
  hecen i ninggureme — 'on top of the city wall'

  jakarame 'along'
  dergi mederi jakarame — 'along the Eastern Sea'

  Of these forms dahame and gojime, are often found with the participles. The other forms are found most often with nouns with the genitive or accusative particle.

Prefatory converb: |
  The prefatory converb is formed by adding the variable suffix -nggala, -nggele, -nggolo to the stem of the verb.
  -nggala is added to back vocalic roots: wajinggala
  -nggele is added to front vocalic words: gerenggele
  -nggolo is added too-vocalic words: onggolo

  bi-, o-, je-
  Three of the most common verbs in Manchu have irregular forms for the imperfect participle:
  bi-, bisire — 'be'
  o-, ojoro — 'become'
  je-, jetere — 'eat'

  Both the imperfect and perfect participles are substantival forms and as such are found as objects, attributes, and predicates; they are verbal inasmuch as they still take objects.
  as object
  gisurere be han donjifi — 'the king having heard what was being said'

  as attribute
  amban ojoro niyalma — 'a man who becomes an official'
  habxara niyalma — 'a man who complains'

  as predicate
  sargan jui be sinde sargan bure — 'I'll give you the girl as a wife'

  mini tacibure anggala — 'not only do I teach'
  sun sirire de — 'while milking'

Temeritive apprehensive converb: |
  -rahv
  The temeritive is formed by adding the invariable suffix -rahv to the same stem that the imperfect participle ending is added to:
  afarahv, ojorahv, tuherahv

  This form shows apprehension on the part of the speaker that something may occur.
  ama nimerahv seme jobombi — 'he is worried lest his father be ill'
  mimbe warahv seme gelembi — 'he fears that they may kill me'

adverbials: |
  In Manchu there is another converb formed by the suffix -tai/-tei/-toi, 
  when attached to a verbal stem, this suffix denotes an extreme degree of an action.

Terminative converb: |
  The terminal converb is formed by adding the variable suffix -tala, -tele, -tolo to the verbroot.
