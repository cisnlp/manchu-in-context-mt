ACCUSATIVE: |
  The marker for ACCUSATIVE is be. Normally, in classical Manchu it is written separately from a word it follows, with the exception of the irregular pronominal stems (see Section 4.1). But there is evidence that the form gisumbe (< gisun “word,” “language” + be) was also in use in old Manchu (Zakharov, 1879:133). 
  The accusative is also considered to be a principal syntactic case marker. Together with the nominative, it is used to mark participants of situations of the outside world. 
  In Manchu, as in other Tungusic languages (and in all Altaic), the expression of the principal syntactic roles is realized through the so-called accusative (nominative-accusative) strategy. That is to say that the case marking of arguments is oriented towards the expression of the opposition between two generalized syntactic roles, namely subject and object. The subject appears in the nominative, and the object is marked by the accusative. In accusative languages, as a rule, the semantic role of experiencer coincides with the role of agent, and the role of patient with that of stimulus (Plungyan, 200:168).
  The main syntactic function of the accusative is to denote a direct complement of the verb. According to this main role in a sentence, the accusative is used to indicate the direct object of a transitive verb:
  i boo be weile-mbi
  he house ACC build-IMPF
  “He builds a house;” bi hergen be ara-mbi
  I letter ACC write-IMPF
  “I write letters” (ZAKH:159);
  emu n’alma (ma. niyalma) bou (ma. boo) be tuak’a-mbi
  one man house ACC guard-IMPF
  (ma. tuwakiya-mbi)
  “A man guards the house;”
  ere sagram-be bi gai-qi o-mbi kai
  this woman-ACC I take-CONV be(AUX)-IMPF MDL.PTL gai-qi o-“(it is) possible to take;” “(I) may take;” “I may take this woman” (SK:48).
  In Manchu there is a number of transitive verbs governing the accusative. The corresponding verbs in other languages often may be intransitive. These verbs are: basu-“to laugh at smb., smth.,” “to make fun of,” “to mock at;” daha-“to follow” (the form of the imperfect converb of this verb that is dahame shifted its category status from converbs to postpositions, with the meaning “according to,” “in accordance with”); ejele-“to be master of,” “to occupy by force,” “establish control over;” kadala-“to manage,” “to control,” “to rule;” to kice-“to care about,” “to concentrate on,” “to be intent on;” leole-“to talk about,” “to deliberate (on);” se-“to order,” “to command;” sebjele-“to rejoice at smth.;” uile-“to serve,” “to wait on (upon).” 
  The following sentences include such verbs:
  ai uttu niyalma be basu-mbi
  what like.this person ACC mock.at-IMPF “How like this (someone) mocks at a person” (ORL:150);
  fe kooli be dahame yabu-mbi
  old regulations ACC according.to act-IMPF “(Someone) acts according to old regulations;”
  ba be ejele-he
  place ACC occupy.by.force-PART
  “(Someone) occupied the place (country) by force;”
  sim-be kadala-ra niyalma akv
  you(si/sin-SG)-ACC control-PART person COP.NEG (there.is.not)
  “There is not a person who controls you” (ZAKH:134);
  amba-sa saisa doro-be kice-mbi,
  high.official(amban)-PL gentleman way-ACC care.about-IMPF
  jemengge be kice-rakv
  food ACC care.about-PART(NEG)
  ambasa saisa “wise man,” “a true gentleman” (NL:15); “Wise men care about the way, not about the food;”
  gemu deribun bisi-re be leole-he-ngge
  all beginning be-PART ACC deliberate.on-PART-NR “deliberation on the being of a common beginning (of things)” (ORL:152);
  sefu sim-be gene se-he teacher you(si/sin- SG)-ACC go(IMP) order-PART “The teacher ordered you to go” (PASH1:97);
  sain be sebjele-me, enduri-be leole-me
  good ACC rejoice.at-CONV spirit-ACC deliberate.on-CONV “to rejoice at good, to deliberate on spirit” (GAB:84);
  ejen be uile-mbi
  suzerain ACC serve-IMPF “(Someone) serves the suzerain” (ZAKH:134).
  In Manchu there are a number of two-placed verbs with mental semantics that govern the accusative. This is unlike other languages having different grammatical systems where certain valencies are filled by nouns in oblique cases: akda-“to depend on,” “to entrust (to),” “to trust;” donji-“to hear about smth.;” gisure-“to speak about smth.,” “to talk about smth;” gvni-“to think about smth., smb.;” hendu-“to speak about smth., smb.” 
  The following sentences include such verbs:
  mujilen be akda-ra
  heart ACC entrust-PART
  “(I) shall entrust the heart (thoughts, plans, intentions) (to smb.)”
  (ORL:149);
  tere niyalma be bi akda-mbi
  that person ACC I trust-IMPF “I trust that person” (ZAKH:133);
  sin-i algin gebu be donji-fi goida-ha you(si/sin- SG)-GEN fame name ACC hear-CONV endure-PART “It lasted for a long time since (I) had heard about your fame name;”
  ojo-rakv be gisure-he-ngge
  do-PART(NEG) ACC speak-PART-NR
  ojorakv = it won’t do (NL:222);
  “what is being spoken (about) won’t do;”
  si mute-rakv bade mim-be ai
  you(si/sin- SG) be.able-PART(NEG) if I(bi/min-)-ACC what
  hendu-me
  speak-CONV “If you are not able, what to speak about me?” (ZAKH:134).
  The accusative may indicate the material from which something is made:
  ulgiyan i cecike i funggala be ilha ara-mbi
  pig GEN small.bird GEN feather ACC flower make-IMPF
  ulgiyan i cecike “ kingfisher” (NL:294);
  “(They) make flowers with a kingfisher’s feathers;”
  ere niyalma na be sangga ara-ha
  this man earth ACC hole make-PART “This man made the hole from the earth” (ORL:154).
  The accusative is obligatory when it indicates direct objects governed by transitive verbs in their negative form:
  cira be tuwa-hakv
  face ACC see-PART(NEG) “(Someone) did not see the face;”
  urgun be cira de tuyembu-raku 
  happiness ACC face DAT reveal-PART(NEG) “(Someone) did not reveal the happiness on a face;”
  emu gisun be tucibu-me mute-rakv
  one word ACC bring.out-CONV be.able-PART(NEG) “(Someone) can not be able to bring out not a single word” (ZAKH:134).
  It may serve to indicate an agent caused to perform the action expressed by the verb in the causative:
  tere be baita icihiya-bu-me gene
  that/he ACC business do-CAUS-CONV go(IMP) “Go and order him to do business” (ZAKH:161).
  The accusative may express space within and means of conveyance by which the motion is going on. It is governed by verbs having semantics of motion:
  morin be yabu-me
  horse ACC ride-CONV
  “to ride a horse” (PASH1:97);
  jugvn be yabu-me
  road ACC go-CONV “to go along the road;”
  bira be doo-me
  river ACC cross-CONV “to cross a river” (PASH1:104-5). hehe ere alim-be (< alin + be; ma. alin be) tafa-ha woman this mountain-ACC go.up-PART “The woman went up the mountain” (SK:48).
  The accusative indicates an adverbial modifier of manner:
  bi suwen-de yargiyan be ala-ra I you (suwe/suwen- PL)-DAT truth ACC say-PART “I say you truly” (literally: “I say the truth to you”);
  mergen be yabu-re urse ulhi-qi
  wise/wisdom ACC act-PART people understand-CONV
  aca-mbi
  meet/fit(AUX)-IMPF
  Tv-qi aca-“should;” “ought,” “must;”
  “One should appreciate people who act wisely” (ORL:151).
  The accusative may follow participles that serve as predicates in
  clauses which are predicative direct complements. This use of the
  accusative will be analysed in detail in regards to the predicative
  declension of participles (see Section 5.6.3). Several examples follow:
  ainu wehe gisure-me mute-re be sabu-hakv
  why stone speak-CONV may-PART ACC perceive-PART(NEG)
  ni?
  INT “Why did you not perceive that stones may speak?” (GAB:112); han’i kvaran’i (ma. kvwarani i) emu ehe sukdun tuci-re khan-GEN stable-GEN one evil spirit appear-PART
  be sabu-ha
  ACC perceive-PART
  “(They) perceived that an evil spirit appeared in the khan’s stable”
  (SK).
  It is very important to note that direct objects are not always indicated
  by the marker for the accusative.
  According to B. K. Pashkov, the use of the accusative marker depends largely on the position of the direct object in a sentence. When a direct object is placed directly before a governing verb, the marker for the accusative can be left out. Any part of a sentence, i.e., subject, indirect object or adverbial modifier of manner may be placed between the direct object and its governing verb. To describe such a position of the direct object, Pashkov introduced into practise the term “distant.” It means that the direct object appears rather far removed in the sentence from the verb that governs it. In such syntactic context the marker for the accusative is obligatory:
  tere niyalma be bi akda-mbi
  that man ACC I trust-IMPF “I trust that man ” (ZAKH:133);
  we sim-be gene se-he who you(si/sin- SG)-ACC go(IMP) say-PART “Who ordered you to go?” (ZAKH:134);
  hergen be saikan ara
  letter ACC good write(IMP) “Write letters better” (PASH1:98-9).

  According to Norman, in the important Manchu dialect, Sibe, the accusative is used with direct objects which have definite or specific reference (Norman, 1974:166).
  As far as classical Manchu is concerned, there is no strict explanation as to when the marker of the accusative is obligatory and when it can be omitted, and the problem needs to be fully investigated. Although it is clear that the appearance of the accusative is closely related with the category of definiteness. Several patterns can be distinguished where the accusative is not used in Manchu:
  1) a direct object and a governing verb are formed from the same root and because of that have the same semantics: etuku etu-“to put on clothing” (etuku “clothing;” etu-“to put on [clothing]”); gucu gucule-“to make friends,” “to be friends with” (gucu “friend;” gucule-“to make friends”); irgebun irgebu-“to sing songs,” “to compose verse” (irgebun “song;” “verse;” irgebu-“to sing songs,” “to compose verse”) (GAB:136); ficakv fica-“to blow a flute” ( ficakv “flute;” fica-“to blow [a flute]”); makcin makci-“to dance” (makcin “dance;” makci-“to dance”); nirugan niru-“to paint a picture” (nirugan “picture,” “painting;” niru-“to paint,” “to draw”) (ORL:154).
  However, there is one exception to this rule as shown by the following example:
  jalan i sebjen be sebjeleworld GEN joy/happiness ACC to.rejoce “to rejoce at happiness of the world” (GAB:136).
  2) in a string of direct objects only the last of them is marked by the accusative:
  eme ama be mafa se-mbi
  mother father ACC ancestor call-IMPF “A mother and a father are called ancestors (mafa)” (ORL:150);
  3) direct objects denoting means and ways of conveyance and governed by transitive verbs:
  jugvn nei-me
  road/way open-CONV
  “to open a road (way)” (PASH1:105); “to open a way (by force)”
  (NL:164).
  4) in subordinate clauses predicates expressed by participles may
  govern direct objects not indicated by the marker of the accusative:
  baita icihiya-ra de tondo oco
  business do-PART DAT honest be(IMP) “When doing business, be honest” (PASH1:111).
  In Manchu there is a number of two-placed verbs the first valency of which is replaced by the direct object not indicated by the accusative. These verbs are: ara-“to do/make smth. with smth.;” weile-“to make smth. with smth.;” obu-“to consider smb./smth. as smb./smth.;” se-“to call smb./smth. by smb./smth.” Here are some examples with the above verbs:
  be sim-be moo-i uren se-mbi? who you(si/sin- SG)-ACC wood-GEN statue call-IMPF “Who call you by wooden statue?;”
  ende-bu-he be hala-rakv o-qi
  err-PASS-PART ACC correct-PART(NEG) be(AUX)-CONV
  tere be endebuku se-mbi
  that ACC mistake call-IMPF “If do not correct errors this is called a mistake” (ORL:150);
  ai be fulehe da obu-mbi ai be temgetu obu-mbi?
  what ACC root base consider-IMPF what ACC proof consider-IMPF
  “What is considered as a base, what is considered as a proof?”
  (ZAKH:133);
  bireme gemu tere be sain se-mbi
  totally all that/he ACC good call-IMPF “Totally all consider him as a good (person)” (PASH1:101);
  na be sangga ara-fi tomo-mbi
  earth ACC hole make-CONV live-IMPF “Made a hole from the earth, (they) live (in it)” (ORL:154).
  When the verb se- has the meaning “to say,” “to speak,” and the whole construction is used in the meaning of the Latin “accusativus cum infinito,” the marker of the accusative indicates the only position which is replaced by a noun having the meaning of a person or by a personal pronoun:
  mim-be gisure-re se-mbi I(bi/min-)-ACC speak-PART say-IMPF “It is said (they say) that it was me who spoke;”
  enen sira-bu-re jalin be
  progeny continue-PASS/CAUS-PART on.account.of ACC
  niyalma-i tuhen se-mbi
  person-GEN purpose say-IMPF “It is said (they say) that continuation of progeny is any person’s purpose” (ORL:154).
  Finally, there can be several direct objects indicated by the accusative marker in a single sentence in Manchu. It is could be explained by the fact that verbal nouns preserve verbal government and themselves may be governed by verbs. The following examples display the occurrance of several markers of the accusative in a single sentence:
  waliya-ha usin be suksala-bu-re be
  abandon-PART field ACC open.to.cultivation-CAUS-PART ACC
  hese-i yabubu-re jalin
  order-GEN carry.out-PART in.order.to “in order to carry out the order to open to cultivation of abandoned fields” (ZAKHL: 967).
  There are two direct complements in this sentence, the first suksalabure be “opening to cultivation” and the second usin be “field for cultivation.” se-re-ngge habxa-ra be akvbu-ki se-qi say-PART-NR accuse-PART ACC stop-OPT say-CONV tere-i that-GEN = their deribun be lashala-ra be wesihun beginning ACC terminate-PART ACC honourable obu-re be hendu-hebi consider.as-PART ACC say-PAST Tv-ki se-“to wish to do smth.,” “to intend to do smth.;” “It is said that he who wishes to stop accusations should consider important to prevent their beginning” (ORL:154).
  The principle predicate hendumbi “(they) say” governs the predicative direct object expressed by the participle in the accusative which is obure be “that (one) should consider.” The latter, in its turn, governs the predicative direct object which is expressed by the participle in the accusative lashalara be “to terminate,” “termination” which governs the noun in the accusative deribun be “beginning.”

GENITIVE: |
  The marker for the GENITIVE/INSTRUMENTAL is i, ni. When nouns are changing in accordance with the requirement of the verb, the final -n of the stem is usually deleted. But in the genitive the final -n is preserved. The marker i is used after words ending in a vowel or in -n. Words ending in a consonant other than n, are followed by ni: gurung ni doro “inside the palace” (ZAKH:128). After words anding in i, especially those borrowed from Chinese, the marker for the genitive may be omitted (Möllendorff, 1892:5). There is evidence that in Sibe, if the noun stem has final -ii, then the genitive marker is zero (Norman, 1974:5). In most cases the marker for the genitive is written separately from words it follows: alin i, gisun i, boo i, gurun i, juse i, mujilen i, na
  i. Occasionally words and the marker for the genitive i following them are written as one: abkai ( abka “sky,” “heaven” + i), biyai (biya “moon,”
  “month” + i), booi (boo “house” + i), erei (ere “this” + i), gisuni (gisun “speech,” “word,” “language” + i), hvdai (hvda “business,” “good”
  + i; hvdai ba “market”), hiyalmai (niyalma “man,” “person” + i).
  The genitive is also considered to be one of the principal syntactic cases. Its primary syntactic function is to express an argument which is governed by a noun. Expressing only one, but a very general syntactic relationship between two nouns, the genitive case accumulated a lot of various semantic functions in the Indo-European languages (Benveniste, 1961).
  It should be mentioned that in Turkic languages the use of a subordinate noun without the genitive marker indicates a non-specific interpretation (Plungyan, 2000:186). The primary semantic function of the genitive is the possessive one, according to which it indicates the possessor of an object, its origin and habitation:
  boo i ejen “the master of the house;”
  house GEN master
  abka-i ejen “the Lord of Heaven, God” (MOLL:5);
  heaven-GEN lord
  abka-i jui “the Son of Heaven, the Emperor”
  heaven-GEN son
  biya i elden “the light of the moon;”
  the moon GEN light
  in-i jaka “his thing;”
  he(i/in-)-GEN thing
  men-i baita “my business;”
  I(bi/min-)-GEN business
  gurun i dasan “the government of the state;”
  state GEN government
  jui i banin “the character of the son” (ZAKH:128).
  son GEN character
  The genitive may also indicate:
  1) part of a whole:
  alin i ninggu “the top of a mountain” (ZAKH:128);
  mountain GEN top
  buhv i weihe “horns of a Manchurian deer;”
  deer GEN horn
  temen i uju “the head of a camel;”
  camel GEN head
  ihan i xan “the ears of a cow;”
  cow GEN ear
  meihe i meifen “the neck of a snake” (ORL:136-7);
  snake GEN neck
  muke i sekiyen “river-head” (SK:47);
  river GEN source
  2) material from which a thing is made:
  yacin dobihi i dahv
  black fox.pelt GEN fur.coat “a fur coat [made] from pelt of black fox;”
  fulgiyan erimbu wehe i jingse
  red precious stone GEM knob.indicating.rank.on.an.official.cap “a knob [made] from red precious stone” (ORL:141); wehe i kvaran (ma. kvwaran) “a stable made from stone (a stone stone GEN workshop stable)” (SK:47);
  3) quantity, measure, and time:
  emu moro i xahvrun muke omi-ha
  one cup GEN cold water drink-PART “(Someone) drank one cup of cold water;”
  nadaci jalan i omolo
  the seventh generation GEN grandson “Grandson seven times removed;”
  ududu biya-i caliyan
  several month-GEN pay.and.provisions “pay and provisions for several months” (ORL:138);
  4) persons according to their kinship and subordination:
  eme i jui “the mother’s son” (NSB:114); mother GEN son han i sargan “the khan’s wife;” khan GEN wife
  ama-i jui “the father’s son (child)” (SK:47);
  father-GEN son
  5) intention with which a thing (or event) is done:
  urgun i doro “the ceremony of congratulation”
  congratulation GEN ceremony
  (MOLL:5).
  Possessive relations may link an agent and the action this agent
  performs. Possessive relations may also link a patient and the current
  state of the patient (or the change the patient undergoes) as well as
  an experiencer and the action of perception of visual or auditory
  information. In this case, the marker of the genitive follows a word
  which denotes a subject of clauses of certain kinds:
  na i tuci-ke jaka
  earth GEN originate.from-PART thing “things which originated from the earth” (ZAKH:128);
  fudzi i hendu-he donji-ha-ngge
  Confucious GEN say-PART heard-PART-NR “(They) heard what Confucious said” (ORL:140);
  dziwen uttu oci terni yargiyan mujilen i
  proper noun if so his honest heart GEN
  gurun i jalin faxa-ha-ngge kai
  country GEN for.the.sake.of exert.effort-PART-NR COP “As far as Dziwen is concerned, his honest heart cares for the sake of fatherland” (ORL:135);
  in-i takvra-ha niyalma he(i/in-)-GEN delegate-PART person “the man delegated by him” (ZAKH:129).
  The attributive function, in its broadest sense, has developed from the possessive function, which is the primary semantic meaning of the genitive. Nouns followed by the marker of the genitive normally serve as attributives in a sentence: doro-i umiyesun “a belt for a court dress or ceremonial garment;” rite-GEN belt doro-i yoro “a ceremonial arrow” (NL:63); rite-GEN arrow
  dorolon i nomun “the book of rites” (PASH1:76); rite GEN classic.book urgun i cira “a merry/lively face” (ZAKH:128); joy GEN face
  tuba i niyalma ji-he
  that.place GEN people come-PART “The people of that place came” (ZAKH:309);
  fe ice i baita, uru waka i arbun
  old new GEN bussines right wrong GEN circumstances
  dursun
  form/pattern/shape
  “old and new businesses; right and wrong circumstances”
  (PASH2:57).
  Occurring after nouns with semantics of objects, the genitive is used
  in combinations of word which become fixed nominal units:
  bithe-i niyalma “scholar;”
  book-GEN person
  cooha-i niyalma “soldier,” “warrior;”
  soldier-GEN person
  golo-i amban “provincial officials of high rank;”
  province-GEN high.official
  monggo i ba “Mongolia” (PASH1:89);
  Mongolia GEN place
  hvda-i niyalma “merchant” (ZAKH:128);
  business-GEN person
  hvda i ba “market,” “marketplace;”
  business GEN place
  hvda i jaka “merchandise” (NL:139);
  business GEN thing
  abka-i fejergi “all under heaven,” “the world,” “China”
  heaven-GEN underneath
  (ORL:136).
  All of the above are listed as stable word-combinations in Norman’s
  Concise Manchu-English Lexicon.
  In Manchu, one sentence may include a sequence of attributes in one noun phrase when attributes ascribe certain qualitative characteristics to the preceding attributes:
  180 part four
  julge-i da-i wang sa-i mujilen i
  ancient.times-GEN leader-GEN monarch PL-GEN intention GEN
  doron be sa-qi o-mbi
  way.of.thinking ACC know-CONV become-IMPF sa-qi o-“(it is) possible to know;” “It is possible to know the way of thinking of monarchs of ancient times” (PASH1:92).
  The genitive is used to attribute qualitative chatacterictics not only to nouns, but to participles and verbs as well. Occurring after nouns having qualitative semantics, the genitive indicates the adverbial modifier of manner:
  giyan fiyan i gama-mbi funcen daban i
  reason appearance GEN arrange-IMPF extra GEN
  icihiya-mbi
  put.in.order-IMPF
  giyan fiyan “reasonable,” “orderly,” giyan fiyan i “in proper order,”
  “in detail” (NL:110);
  funcen daban “extra and excess,” funcen daban i “excessively” (NL:95);
  “(Someone) has arranged (deels) properly, and put (everything) in
  order excessively” (PASH2:58);
  tere sahal’an (ma. sahaliyan) buhu (ma. buha) amba jilgan’i
  that black bull loud voice-GEN
  sure-me (ma. sure-me) kaica-fi yabu-ha
  shout-CONV yell-CONV go-PART
  “That bull yelled with loud voice (loudly) and went away;”
  ama eme be saikan’i gingule-me (ma. ginggule-me) banji
  father mother ACC rather.well-GEN respect-CONV live(IMP)
  “Respecting your father and mother, (let you) live well” (SK:47);
  bi sain mujilen i niyalma be tuwa-ra o-qi,
  I good intention GEN people ACC look.at-PART be(AUX)-CONV
  niyalma urunakv sain mujilen i mimbe tuwa-mbi people surely good intention GEN I(bi/min-)-ACC look.at-IMPF “If I look at people with good intention then people surely look at me with good intention” (ZAKH:129).
  Adverbs are normally formed by repeating the noun followed by the genitive marker: cun cun i “gradually;” dahvn dahvn i “repeatedly”
  (dahvn “again”); giyan giyan i “in proper order” (giyan “order,” “proper”); siran siran i “continually” (siran “continuation”); ulhiyen ulhiyen i “gradually” (ulhiyen “gradual”) (ZAKHL, NL). The genitive may also denote the following additional meanings:
  1) distributive:
  geren saisa i uju o-me mute-hebi
  all scholar GEN the.first become-CONV be.able-PAST “He was able to become the first of all scholars” (ORL:137);
  gucu gucule-re-ngge niyalma-i sunja ciktan i emke
  friend make.friends-PART-NR people-GEN five principle GEN one (as substantive)
  “The fact that people make friends is one of the five principles of people” (ZAKH:128-9);
  2) instrumental:
  angga i fodoro-me
  mouth GEN pant-CONV “to pant with mouth;”
  bulukan i muke i silgiya-ra
  warm GEN water GEN rinse-PART “rinsing with warm water” (ORL:140);
  ere suhe-i saci-mbi
  this axe-GEN chop-IMPF
  “(I) shall chop with this axe;”
  tere futa-i anga (ma. angga) be hvaita-fi (ma. hvwaita-fi)
  that rope-GEN hole ACC tie.up-CONV
  “tied up a hole with that rope” (SK:47);
  amba-sa saisa niyalma i
  high.official(amban)-PL scholar/gentleman people GEN
  niyalma be dasa-mbi
  people ACC rule-IMPF
  ambasa saisa “a worthy, wise man,” “a true gentleman” (NL:15);
  “Wise men rule over people by means of people” (GAB:65).
  In Manchu, nouns are normally followed by the genitive before a
  number of postpositions. The genitive marker does not in this case
  182 part four
  express a certain kind of a relation between the noun and the
  postposition, it merely serves is a formal link between them. Here
  are some examples where the genitive marker serves as a formal
  device linking a noun and a postposition following it:
  bira-i cala “on the other side of the river;”
  river-GEN on.the.other.side
  mujilen i dolo “in a heart;”
  heart GEN inside
  sin-i emgi gisure-ki
  you(si/sin- SG)-GEN with speak-OPT
  “(I) shall speak to you;”
  sin-i baru ala-ki
  you(si/sin- SG)-GEN to tell-OPT
  “(I) shall tell you;”
  tere-i jalin gisure-he
  this/he-GEN for.the.sake.of speak-PART “(Someone) spoke for the sake of him” (ZAKH:128-130);
  yao sun i forgon i gese
  proper name proper name GEN time GEN like “like at the times of Yao and Sun” (ORL:138).

DATIVE: |
  The marker for the DATIVE/LOCATIVE is -de. Like the accusative, the dative does not follow the law of vowel harmony. In most cases the marker of the dative is written separately from the word it follows, with several exceptions to the rule. The marker and irregular forms of personal pronouns are normally written as one. The marker de and the copula bi are also written as one in the following patterns: amargi debi “it is situated in the north;” dergi debi “it is situated in the east;” julergi debi “it is situated in the south;” wargi debi “it is situated in the west.”
  Like the accusative, the dative plays a very important role in the structure of Manchu utterances. Although the dative is oriented towards the expression of the peripheral semantic roles of arguments, it is used to express many of these. The dative is primarily used to indicate the semantic role of recipient, which is normally combined together with the role of addressee and in some languages with the semantic roles of benefactive and experiencer. All of these semantic roles are generalized by the case for the syntactic indirect object,
  i.e. the dative (Plungyan, 2000:169-70). The semantic role of instrument, which is considered to be a peripheral argument, is also marked by the dative in Manchu. Being a polyfunctional case, the dative is used in Manchu to indicate circumstantial semantic roles, primarily, to express space and temporal relationships. Correspondingly, the dative has two basic syntactic functions: it is used to indicate an indirect object and adverbial modifier, mostly of place and, less frequently, time and cause.
  Indicating an indirect object, the dative refers to the recipient of the action or the addressee of speech or another action:
  ere niyalma de bu-mbi
  this man DAT give-IMPF “(Someone) gives to this man;”
  tere niyalma de hendu-he
  that man DAT say-PART “(Someone) said to that man” (MOLL:5);
  abka-de hengkile-mbi
  heaven-DAT kowtow-IMPF “(I) kowtow to heaven” (ZAKH:130); 
  ere sunja niyalma tere asihata de fonji-ha
  this five man that guy DAT ask-PART
  “These five men asked that guy;”
  wan be dang de jaka hacin hacin boobai ulin ulha adun gemu labdu bu-fi
  proper name DAT thing various various treasure property cattle cattle all many give-CONV
  wan be dang = proper name; “Wan Be Dang was given all kinds of things—treasure, property and cattle” (SK:48).
  The dative may indicate the agent of a passive verb:
  bi in-de gele-bu-he
  I he-DAT fear-PASS-PART “I was scared of him” (I was frightened by him) (ZAKH:162);
  … julergi gurun joo de wa-bu-fi
  senior ruling.house zhao DAT kill-PASS-CONV “(They) were killed by the Senior Zhao ruling house;”
  amargi joo gurun de mukiye-bu-hebi
  junior zhao ruling.house DAT extinguish-PASS-PAST “(It) was extinguished by the Junior Zhao ruling house” (ORL:145).
  The dative may indicate a person who is the possessor of something. A predicate of such a sentence is expressed by the verb bi-“to be,” “to exist” (or by the copula bi), which takes the meaning “to have,” “to possess” in such constructions as following:
  ahun de bithe bi
  elder.brother DAT book COP(have/there.is) “The elder brother has a book;”
  bithe-i niyalma usin i haha weile-re faksi
  book-GEN person field GEN man work-PART workman
  hvda-i urse de men-i
  business-GEN people DAT we(be/men-EXCL)-GEN
  men-i ula-ha tacin bi
  we-GEN pass.on-PART skill COP
  bithei nyalma “scholar,” usin i haha “tenant farmer,” weilere faksi
  “workman,” hvdai niyalma “merchant” (NL:31, 300, 138);
  “Be he scholar, farmer, workman or merchant, every man has some
  skills to pass on” (ORL:147);
  min-de gisun bi-fi sin-de fonji-ki
  I(bi/min-)-DAT word be-CONV you(si/sin- SG)-DAT ask-OPT
  se-mbi
  say(AUX)-IMPF
  Tv-ki se-“to want/wish to do smth.;”
  “I have a word, (I) want to ask you about” (literally); “There is
  something I want to ask you about”(ZAKH:131).
  The dative may indicate parenthetical words denoting the source
  of a statement (dictum) or quotation:
  min-i gvnin de “in my opinion” (ZAKH:144);
  I(bi/min-)-GEN thought DAT
  ejen i hese de “according to the emperor’s edict”
  emperor GEN edict DAT
  (ZAKH:131).
  The dative also indicates an instrument of the action:
  angga de hvla, mujilen de eje
  mouth DAT read(IMP) mind DAT memorize(IMP) “Use your lips to read and your brain to remember;”
  tere-i elden de eldexe-me
  that-GEN light DAT shine-CONV “Being illuminated by that light … ” (ORL:145).
  Both the genetive and the dative are used to indicate an instrument, but there is a difference between them. The dative is used with verbs in the past:
  beye-i gala-de jafa-habi
  self-GEN hand-DAT catch-PAST “(Someone) caught with his hand;”
  beye-i gala-i gaisu
  self-GEN hand-GEN take(IMP) “Take with your hand” (ZAKH:132).
  The dative is used when people talk about someone else’s activities:
  si yasa-de twva-ki you(si/sin- SG) eye-DAT see-OPT “You see with your eyes”(ZAKH:132).
  But when the question is about someone’s own activity, then the genitive is used:
  min-i yasa-i tuwa-qi ... I(bi/min-)-GEN = my eye-GEN see-CONV “Seeing with my own eyes ... ” (ZAKH:132).
  Serving as an adverbial modifier of place, time, and cause the dative may show:
  1) location in space (in, at):
  alin bujan-de tomo-mbi
  mountain forest-DAT live-IMPF “(They) live in mountains and forests;”
  kuwecihe boo-de uji-mbi
  pigeon house-DAT nurture-IMPF
  “A pigeon is nurtured by a household” (ORL:146);
  abka de deye-re gasha bi
  sky DAT fly-PART large.bird COP
  na de feksi-re gurgu bi
  earth DAT run-PART wild.animal COP “Those flying in the sky are birds: running on the earth are wild animals” (ZAKH:131); bi ere ba de xim-be (ma. sim-be) ala-me I this place DAT you(xi/xin- SG)-ACC wait.for-CONV ningun (ma. ninggun) an’a (ma. aniya) o-ho six year become-PART “Six years passed since I began waiting for you here (in this place)” (SK:47);
  2) destination (towards, upon, on):
  tugi de sucuna-me deye-mbi
  cloud DAT soar-CONV fly-IMPF “(They) fly soaring towards the clouds” (ORL:147);
  ce boo-de isinji-ha

  tere bou (ma. boo) i uce de yabu-me ixina-ha (ma. isina-ha)
  that house GEN door DAT do-CONV arrive.at-PART
  “(Someone) arrived at the door of that house” (SK:47);
  3) location in time (it should be mentioned that in a simple sentence
  an adverbial modifier of time is more often expressed by the
  nominative):
  tere nergin-de “at that time,” “at that moment” (ZAKH:131);
  that time/moment-DAT
  uju-i biya-de “at the first moon” (ORL:147);
  first-GEN moon-DAT
  muda-ra erin-de ere ba-be boljon obu-ki
  return-PART time-DAT this place-ACC agreement make-OPT “Let us make an agreement when to return to this place” (SK:48);
  4) the limits of a certain length of road or space of time (from... to, from ... until):
  golo-i hecen ci gemun hecen de
  province-GEN city ABL capital city DAT “from a provincial city to the capital” (ZAKH:131);
  julge-qi te de isitala
  ancient.times-ABL now DAT until “from ancient times until the present” (ORL:144);
  5) as far as the temporal meaning of the dative is concerned, it is mostly found in complex sentences, in clauses expressing semantics of time. Following participles, the dative indicates a general temporal meaning:
  amba-sa teike gene-re de ala-ha
  high.official-PL the.moment go-PART DAT report-PART “The moment the high officials were about to go, (he) reported to them;”
  tuwa-ra de ja gojime, yabu-re de mangga
  look.at-PART DAT easy though perform-PART DAT difficult “Though easy to watch, it is difficult to perform” (ZAKH:131);
  in-i kemuni leole-me gisure-re-de ... he(i/in-)-GEN still discuss-CONV speak-PART-DAT “when he was still discussing ... ” (ZAKH:132);
  ama-i bisi-re-de tere-i gvnin be tuwa-mbi
  father-GEN be/exist-PART-DAT that-GEN opinion ACC look-IMPF “When father was alive, (they) listened to his opinion” (PASH2:106);
  6) the dative may indicate an adverbial modifier of manner: jobolon de “sorrowfully,” urgun de “joyfully,” doron de “according to rites,” “ceremonially;”
  7) cause:
  emu gisun de mergen obu-mbi, emu gisun de mergen akv
  one word DAT wise make-IMPF one word DAT wise COP.NEG (there.is.not)
  “One word can give rise to wisdom or foolishness (ORL:144).
  The dative is usually governed by nouns and verbs having semantics
  of evaluation such as ja “easy,” mangga “difficult,” sain “well,” amuran “fond of,” “intent on,” duibule-“to compare,” etc.:
  sa-ra de ja
  learn-PART DAT easy “it is easy to learn;”
  sure-be yabu-re de amuran
  wisdom-ACC perform-PART DAT intent.on “being intent on performing wisely” (ORL:143);
  arsari urse de duibule-qi ojo-rakv
  ordinary people DAT compare-CONV be(AUX)-PART(NEG) “(He) cannot be compared with ordinary people” (ORL:144);
  yabu-re de mangga
  perform-PART DAT difficult “it is difficult to perform;”
  jete-re de amuran, yabu-re de banuhvn eat(je-)-PART DAT good.at work-PART DAT lazy “Being good at eating, but lazy to work” (literally); “Being greedy for food but with no appetite for work” (ZAKH:131).
  The verbs that have emotional semantics such as akda-“to trust;” daya-“to be dependent on,” “to rely on;” gele-“to fear;” giru-“to feel ashamed;” golo-“to be startled,” “to be scared;” gucule-“to make friend;” jaila-“to avoid,” “to get out of the way of;” jobo-“to suffer;” sengguwe-“to fear,” “to dread;” ubiya-“to loathe;” targa-“to abstain from” also govern the dative:
  muten akv de jobo-mbi
  capability there.is.not DAT suffer-IMPF
  “(Someone) suffers when there is no capability (to do smth.)” (literally);
  “Incapability brings suffering” (ORL:143);
  faksi anggalinggv de gucule-re de o-qi ekiyende-mbi
  shrewd glib DAT make.friends-PART DAT be(AUX)-CONV be.lacking-IMPF
  “When making friends with glib (persons) then (someone) will be deficient” (literally); “Glib friends are unsatisfactory;”

  lust quarrel DAT avoid(IMP) “Lust and quarrels are best avoided;”
  fusihvn de fonji-re de giru-rakv
  junior DAT ask-PART DAT be.ashamed-PART(NEG) “There is no shame in (asking) taking advice from the young” (ORL:144);
  abka de ubiya-fi
  heaven DAT loathe-CONV “being loathed by Heaven” (ZAKH:130);
  in-i donji-rakv de gele-me golo-mbi he(i/in-)-GEN hear-PART(NEG) DAT fear-CONV be.scared-IMPF “He is afraid of not being able to hear” (PASH2:41; MB).
  The dative is also governed by the following verbs: aca-“to meet,” “to meet together,” “to correspond to,” “to fit,” “to be equal;” aliya-“to wait;” bai-“to ask for;” donji-“to listen,” “to hear;” fonji-“to ask;” holbo-“to get married;” isina-“to reach;” taci-“to learn,” “to study,” “to become accustomed to.” Here are some examples with these verbs:

  190 part four
  In Manchu, many nouns are changed into syntactic words, mostly postpositions, by the attachment of the dative marker. The nouns themselves show a tendency to lose their lexical meaning, becoming partly desemanticized. Some of these words can serve as conjunctions in complex sentences.
  The following postpositions occur quite frequently: bade “if,” “in the case that” (ba “place,” “occasion,” “reason,” “condition”); dade “in addition to” (da “root,” “base,” “foundation”); erinde “when” (erin “time”); fonde “when” (fon “time”); jakade “to the presence of,” “up to,” “by,” “in front of” (jaka “thing,” “object”); jalinde “for the sake of” (jalin “reason,” “motive”); sidende “in between” (siden “space,” “interval”); turgunde “because,” “since” (turgun “reason,” “motive”). Syntactic functions of these words will be described in more detail in chapters dedicated to postpositions and conjunctions (see 8).
  Finally, if there are several homogeneous parts of the sentence to be indicated by the dative marker, only the last one is actually marked.

ABLATIVE: |
  The marker for the ABLATIVE is -qi. The ablative is grouped together with the so-called locative cases which are used to express space relationships. The ablative is used to indicate adverbial modifiers which denote the starting point in space or in time. In accordance with this basic function, the ablative displays the following syntactic meanings:
  1) it indicates a starting point in space:
  boo-qi tuci-ke
  house-ABL go.away-PART “(Someone) went away from the house “ (ZAKH: 135);
  uba-qi goro akv
  this.place-ABL far COP.NEG (there.is.not) “not far from this place (from here)” (PASH2:22);
  abka ci wasi-mbi
  sky/heaven ABL descend-IMPF “(Smth.) is descending from the sky;”
  na ci banji-mbi
  earth ABL be.born-IMPF “(Smth.) is growing from the earth” (PASH1:61);
  bi goro ba-qi ulin bota-mbi seme ji-he
  I distant place-ABL wealth catch-IMP in.order.(to) come-PART
  morphology 191
  bota—(ma. buta-) “to catch (game or fish);” “I came from a distant place to gain wealth;”
  ere ejen-i yamun-qi goro akv emu amba luce
  this khan(GEN) palace-ABL far there.is.not one big tower bisi-re bou (ma. boo) bi-he bi be-PART house be-PART COP “Not far from the khan’s palace there was a house with a big tower” (SK:48);
  2) a starting point in time:
  dergi de guri-he qi
  east DAT move-PART ABL “since (they) moved to the east” (ZAKH:135);
  ajigen-qi ere-i adali ferguecuke gasha be
  childhood-ABL this-GEN like wonderful bird ACC xue (ma. xuwe) sabu-rakv not.at.all see-PART(NEG) “I haven’t seen a bird as wonderful as this since childhood” (SK:48);
  3) a starting point of a length of road or space of time in constructions of the type “from ... to,” “from ... until”:
  gemun hecen qi golo-i hecen de
  capital city ABL province-GEN city DAT
  sandalabu-ha-ngge goro
  be.distant.from-PART-NR far
  “It is a great distance from the capital city to a provincial city”
  (ZAKH:135);
  da-qi dube-de isitala
  beginning-ABL end-DAT until “from the beginning to the end” (PASH1:131);
  4) the meaning of separation:
  ama eniye qi fakca-fi, boo-qi alja-fi
  father mother ABL separate-CONV house-ABL leave-CONV
  inenggi goida-ha
  day last.for.a.long.time-PART
  “Since he separated from (his) father and mother and left the family, a long time has passed” (ZAKH:135). In his Grammar, Möllendorff gave a different translation of the above sentence: “Taking leave of his father and mother, he was long separated from his family” (Möllendorff, 1892:6).
  5) the ablative marks an object with which something is compared (an object of comparison):
  ere erin qi oyonggo ningge akv
  this time ABL important SBSTR COP.NEG (there.is.not) “There is no time more important than the present” (ORL:156);
  tere ere-qi sain
  that this-ABL good “that is better than this” (ZAKH:135);
  nenehe qi beye umuxi labdu sain o-ho
  former ABL myself very much good become-PART “In comparison with the former I became much better” (SK:48);
  6) the ablative has distributive meaning:
  ya-qi neneme ji-he bi-he
  what-ABL the.first come-PART be-PART “Which came first?” (MOLL:6).
  In Manchu, the ablative is governe d by the following verbs: fakca-“to leave,” “to separate;” alja-“to leave;” tuci-“to come out,” “to go out,” “to emerge,” “to appear:”
  bi boo-qi je-fi tuci-ke I house-ABL eat-CONV go.out-PART
  “Having eaten, I went out from the house” (ORL:155);
  idu qi hoko-mbi, niyaman qi fakca-mbi, boo qi alja-mbi, jobolon qi jaila-mbi
  a.turn.at.duty ABL part-IMPF relative ABL separate-IMPF house ABL leave-IMPF disaster ABL avoid-IMPF
  “(Someone) leaves his turn at duty, parts from his relatives, leaves his home and avoids disaster” (PASH2:35).
  The postposition tulgiyen “besides” also governs the ablative:
  tere-qi tulgiyen buye-rakv
  this-ABL besides desire-PART(NEG)
  “(Someone) desires nothing besides (more than) this” (GAB).

PROLATIVE: |
  As for the deri-form in classical Manchu, scholars who consider it
  case marker differ in specifying its meaning. Those who recognize
  deri as a case often use different terms to designate it.
  According to Zakharov, the marker deri can be used instead of the marker of the ablative ci (Zakharov, 1879:136). He gives some examples in his Grammar: dorgideri “from inside;” tulergideri “from outside;”
  giyamun deri gene-he
  station from go.away-PART “(Someone) went away from (left) a station;”
  muke-i jugvn deri ji-he
  water-GEN way by come-PART “(Someone) came by water” (ZAKH:136).
  Here are some more examples:
  muke gisari deri tuci-mbi
  wather spring from go.out-IMPF “Water stems from a spring;”
  edun sangga deri dosi-mbi
  wind opening through enter-IMPF “Wind goes through a slot;”
  fa deri gala be jafa-mbi
  window from hand ACC seize-IMPF “(Someone) from a window seizes the hand” (PASH2:65).
  G. Kiyose used the term “prolative” to designate the deri-case form (Kiyose, 1997:150). J. Norman classified the deri-form together with the ci-form as the ablative for classical Manchu (Norman, 1974:165). As far as Sibe is concerned with respect to these two locative cases, the distribution of meaning between the case markers ci and deri suggested by Norman is different from the meaning these markers have in Radlov’s texts. There ci is used to denote one of the functional variants of the ablative, with the main meaning of a starting point (in space or in time), and deri corresponds roughly to the separative
  case (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:49). There are a number of instances where deri is used in comparative constructions:
  encu hehe-si deri fulu tuwa-mbi
  other woman-PL from better consider-IMPF “(He) began to consider her better than other women;” 
  sini hojihon tere ahvn deo ninggun niyalma deri getuhun mergen kiyangkiyan batur bi-me haha sain
  you son-in-law that elder.brother younger.brother six man from awake wise powerful hero be-CONV man good “Your son-in-law in comparison with his six brothers is a very wise and powerful hero and a good man” (SK:49).

derivative suffix used to form nouns of quality: |
  Nominal words of quality may be derived from object nouns by the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo: boconggo “coloured,” “colourful” (boco “colour”); erdemungge “virtuous,” “talented,” “moral” (erdemu “capability,” “virtue,” power”); gosingga “beloved,” “compassionate,” “cherished,” “loving,” “merciful” (gosin “mercy,” “pity,” “love”); horonggo, horonggu “powerful,” “majestic,” “possessing great authority” (horon “power,” “majesty,” “authority”); moringga “pertaining to the horse,” “mounted;” “horseman,” “rider” (morin “horse”). The final -n of a stem is deleted before the addition of the suffix -ngga/-ngge/ -nggo. According to Iv. Zakharov from whose grammar some examples are taken, the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo is the only one by which the proper adjective forms of the nouns, having semantics of quality, are formed in Manchu (Zakharov, 1879:77-8).
  There is another point of view concerning the nature of this suffix. According to E.P. Lebedeva, originally the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo was used to mark possession. It may be attached to both semantic groups of nouns, viz. to those having the meaning of object in the broad sense and those having semantics of quality: ujungga “first,” “leading” (uju “head,” “first”); ubungge “pertaining parts, portions or shares” (ubu “part,” “portion,” “share,” “responsibility”); hacingga “with distinctions,” “different/various (kinds)” (hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item”); hvsungge “powerful,” “mighty” (hvsun “strength,” “power,” “might”); baitangga “business,” “necessary” (baita “matter,” “affair,” “business,” “event”), enduringge “divine,” “holy,” “sacred” (enduri “spirit,” “god,” “deity”), etc. Some of these nouns taking on   a new qualitative meaning reveal a tendency to shift their category status from object nouns to the class of adjectives: baitangga, boconggo, horonggo, hvsungge.

Plurals: |
  The most commonly used suffixes for plurals (or more properly collectives) are -sa/-se/-so, -ta/-te, -si and -ri.
  The suffixes -sa and -se are used with nouns denoting age, generation and relatives (kinsmen and kinswomen): ecike “father’s young brother (uncle)”—ecikese “father’s young brothers (uncles);” gege “elder sister” (also a respectful term of address to young ladies)— gegese “elder sisters;” jui “son,” “child”—juse “sons,” “children;” sadun “father of the son-in-law,” “father of the daughter-in-law”—sadusa “fathers of the son-in-law, the daughter-in-law;” sagda “old man”— sagdasa “old men”2.
  These suffixes are also used with nouns denoting peoples and nations, posts, ranks, titles and occupations: age “prince, son of an emperor” (also a polite term of address, master, sir, lord)—agese “princes, sons of an emperor” (also sirs, masters); amban “high official”—ambasa “high officials,” antaha “guest”—antahasa “guests;” bayan “rich man”—bayasa “rich men;” beile “ruler,” “prince of the third rank”—beile se “rulers,” “princes;” faksi “craftman,” “workman”—faksisa “craftmen,” “workmen;” gucu “friend”—gucuse “friends;” hafan “official,” “officer”—hafasa “officials,” “officers;” han “khan,” “emperor”—han sa “khans,” “emperors;” irgen “people,” “nation”—irgese “peoples,” “nations;” lama “lama,” “monk”—lamasa
  “lamas,” “monks;” manju “Manchu”—manjusa “the Manchus;” nikan “Chinese”—nikasa “the Chinese;” oros “Russian”—oros se “the Russians;” xabi “pupil,” “student”—xabisa “pupils,” “students”3. The suffix -so is found in the names of peoples and nations: monggo “Mongol”—monggoso “the Mongols;” solho “Korean” – solhoso “the Koreans;” also gioro “the name of the Manchu dynasty clan”—gioro so (in old Manchu books it was often used in the form gioro se); giohoto “beggar”—giohoto so “beggars.”
  The suffix -si is used with some nouns denoting age, relative relationships and status of human beings: aha “slave”—ahasi “slaves;” haha “male,” “man”—hahasi “males,” “men” (the polite plural form haha niyalma); hehe “female,” “woman”—hehesi “females,” “women” (the polite plural form hehe urse); hojihon “son-in-law”—hojihosi “sons-in-law;” omolo “grandson”—omosi “grandsons.”
  The suffixes -ta and -te are used with words denoting the age of human beings, generation and relatives: ahvn “elder brother”—ahvta “elder brothers;” ama “father”—amata “fathers;” ambu “mother’s elder sister”—ambuta “mother’s elder sisters;” amji “father’s elder brother”—amjita “father’s elder brothers;” amu “father’s elder sister”—amuta “father’s elder sisters;” asihan “young man”—asihata “young men;” axa “elder brother’s wife”—axata “elder brother’s wives;” efu “the husband of one’s elder sister,” “wife’s elder brother,” “the husband of wife’s elder sister” – efute “husbands of one’s elder sister,” “wife’s elder brothers,” “husbands of wife’s elder sister;” eigen “husband”—eigete “husbands;” ejen “ruler,” “lord,” “master,” “emperor”—ejete “rulers,” “lords,” “masters;” eme “mother”—emete “mothers;” eshen “father’s younger brother (uncle)”—eshete “father’s younger brothers (uncles);” eyun “elder sister”—eyute “elder sisters;” da “foreman”—data “foremen;” dehema “husband of mother’s sister (uncle)”—dehemata “husbands of mother’s sister (uncles); deheme
  3 The plural suffix -se should be distinguished from the morpheme -se which some Chinese loan words contain. In the Chinese borrowings the morpheme -se (in Manchu transcription) represents the Chinese morpheme -zi: ma. cise “pond” < chin. chizi; ma. dangse “register” < chin. dangzi; dengse “steelyard” < chin. dengzi; kose “pants,” “trousers” < chin. kuzi; pase “a rake” < chin. pazi; panse “plate,” “tray” < chin. panzi; tangse “the imperial shamanic shrines in Peking and Mukden” < chin. tangzi ( Zakharov, 1879:121; CD). Norman translates the word panse as “chessboard,” “measure for games of chess” (NL:226).
  “mother’s younger sister (aunt)”—dehemete “mother’s younger sisters (aunts);” deo “younger brother”—deote “younger brothers;” ge “husband’s elder brother”—gete “husband’s elder brothers;” gu “father’s sister”—gute “father’s sisters;” gufu “husband of father’s sister”—gufute “husbands of father’s sister;” meye “younger sister’s husband “—meyete “younger sister’s husbands” (in old language this word also meant “wife’s younger brother”—NL:197); nakcu “mother’s brother”—nakcuta “mother’s brothers” (also nakcusa, nakcuse); naca “wife’s elder brother”—nacata “wife’s elder brothers;” non “younger sister”—nota “younger sisters;” oke “the wife of father’s younger brother”—okete “wives of father’s younger brother;” sargan “wife”— sargata “wives” (also sargasa); uhume “father’s younger brother’s wife”
  – uhumete “father’s younger brother’s wives;” ungga “the elder in generation”—unggata “elders in generation” (Zakharov, 1879:120-3; Pashkov, 1963:19-20).
  Suffix -ri occurs only with a few words: mafa “grandfather”—mafari “grandfathers,” mama “grandmother”—mamari “grandmothers.” Both words are also used in the meaning “ancestors,” “forefathers.”
  One can see that some words are used with various plural suffixes: agu = a respectful term of address for men: sir, master—agusa, aguse; nakcu “uncle (mother’s brother)”—nakcusa, nakcuse, nakcuta “uncles (mother’s brothers);” sargan “wife”—sargasa, sargata “wives;” urun “daughter-in-law,” “sister-in-law”—urusa, uruse “daughters-in-law,” “sisters-in-law.”
  There is no strict rule governing whether the plural suffix should be written together with a noun stem or separately (for instance: beile se, han sa, oros se). But in most cases the plural suffix and a noun stem are written as one word.
  It should be noted that final -n, -i and -lo are deleted in some words before the addition of the plural suffix: amban “high official,” “dignitary”—ambasa “high officials;” jui “son,” “child”—juse “sons,” “children;” omolo “grandson”—omosi “grandsons.”
  composite suffixes coincide with those which can be found in collective nouns, numerals, and other parts of speech in Tungusic. In collective nouns, these suffixes convey the meaning of various groups of people or collections of objects which are the results of human activities. In plurals formed by the composite suffixes in which a morpheme for collectivity and a morpheme for plurality have merged, the idea concerning human society, the tribal system, clans and kindred groups of people becomes more emphasized. The archaic character of this group of nouns, its isolation from the others and, more importantly, the fact that it denotes the collective and comitative meanings, all leads to the conclusion that historically a grammatical category conveying the collective meaning preceded the grammatical category of plurality in Tungusic. As far as Manchu is concerned, it is difficult to ascertain whether the language had lost the suffix -l denoting plurality in Tungusic, with the exception of Udeghe and Oroch, or had never had it (Tzintzius, 1946:73-119).
  In Manchu, the suffix -sa/-se had the collective meaning in the past. The moribund collective morpheme -se can be found in the Manchu word urse “people.” This suffix corresponds to the Ude word se “clan (a group of persons originating from a male ancestor and united by recognition of their blood relationship),” “nationality,” “family,” “kind,” “sort,” “type.” In its turn the Ude word se is a part of a semantic group of words related to the word “blood” in Tungusic: evenk. sekse, neg. sakse, oroch. saksa, ud. sake, ulch. sekse, nan. sekse, ma. senggi; also neg. senggi “relatives by marriage;” ma. senggi o-“to drink blood,” senggile-“ to act in a bloody manner;” senggileme afa-“to fight a bloody battle;” senggime “bloody,” “love between brothers;” “kindred love;” “intimite,” “friendly,” “on good terms.”
  The Manchu suffix -ta/-te corresponds to various pronominal elements in Tungusic: the Manchu-Tungus demonstrative pronoun ta-/te-“that,” personal pronoun for the third person, plural ta-/te-“they,” possessive suffix for the third person, plural -tan/-ten in Even (Lamut) and -tin in Evenki.
  It is more difficult to determine the origin of the suffix -ri since there are no words beginning with r in the Manchu-Tungus languages (and in general, in Altaic). It probably corresponds to the same component found in the Tungusic demonstrative pronouns: even., evenk. e-r, e-ri, e-re “this;” ta-r, ta-ri, ta-ra “that.” This suffix is not widely spread.
  Tzintzius came to the conclusion that grammatical categories denoting collective and comitative meanings preceded the grammatical category of plurality in the Tungus-Manchu languages. These categories originated from pronouns, collective nouns, and names of human groups, that is nation, people, clan, tribe (Tzintzius, 1946:73-119).
  In Manchu, the plural may be formed analytically, by adding words denoting collective meaning or plurality. Some of these words like eiten “all,” “every;” geren “all,” “many,” “numerous,” “the various …;” yooni “all,” “all together,” “complete,” “entire;” labdu “many,” “much;” ududu “some,” “several,” “many,” “a number of,” normally precede nouns. Here are some examples: eiten jaka “everything,” “every object;” geren niyalma “all/many men/persons.” The word geren is also used in combination with plural forms: geren ambasa hafasa “many officials;” geren xabisa “many pupils,” “many students.” This is a single case when synthetic means of expressing plurals combine with an analytical one (pleonasm).
  Other words having the same semantics, such as gemu “all,” tome “every,” each,” always follow nouns: bayan gemu “all rich men;” gurgu tome “ every wild animal;” irgen gemu “all people;” moro tome “every bowl;” niyalma tome “every man/person,” “people;” yadahvn gemu “all poor men” (Pashkov, 1963:20).
  Plurality may be expressed by adding generic words denoting the biological class of living beings: gasha “bird,” gurgu “wild animal,” “beast;” niyalma “man,” “person;” ulha “domestic animal,” urse “men,” “people,” “persons.” The word urse chiefly follows nouns of quality or participles: bayan urse “rich men;” ehe urse “the villains;” tacire urse “the scholars” (taci-re = taci-“to learn” , “to study” + -re , the suffix for the imperfect participle). The words hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item” and jergi “class,” “degree,” “group,” “rank” should be included in this group. All these words are placed after the relevant nouns.
  Plurality can be expressed with the help of the words hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item” and jergi “category,” “grade,” “rank,” “sort.” Following the marker for the genitive case added to the noun, these words denote both plurality of objects and the belonging of the latter to a certain class, kind or sort. Following the noun directly, they denote plurality with the shade of meaning “of different/various kinds, every kind.” The word jergi is normally used with animate objects and the word hacin with inanimate objects. Here are some examples: baita hacin “different/various matters/affairs;” giyahvn jergi
  gasha “falcons, hawks and other related birds;” gurgu jergi “different/ various wild animals,” “animal world;” kooli hacin “regulations and precedents;” orho hacin “herbs,” “plants;” tasha jergi gurgu “the tigers and other related beasts;” tasha i jergi gurgu “beasts belonging to the tiger family;” tubihe hacin “fruits” (Zakharov, 1879:123).
  In Manchu, special combinations consisting of two words are used to denote the collective meaning. The first word is represented by a cardinal number which is an attribute to the following noun. Such combinations originated from the Chinese patterns: duin ergi “the four corners of the world” (literally, “the four sides” < chin. sifang “(four) all sides,” “(four) all quarters”); duin mederi “the whole country,” “all kingdoms,” “the whole world” (literally, “the four seas washing the earth” < chin. sihai “the four seas,” “the whole country,” “the whole world” ); sunja hacin i jeku “cereals” (literally, “five kinds of cereal” < chin. wugu “the five cereals: rice, two kinds of millet, wheat and beans”); tanggv hafan “the officials” (literally, “one hundred officials” < chin. baiguan “one hundred officials,” “the officials” ); tanggv hala “people” (literally,”one hundred families” < chin. baixing “one hundred family names,” “common people”); tumen baita “a great number of affairs” (literally, “ten thousand affairs” < chin. bainshi “a hundred affairs,” “all kinds of affairs,” “numerous affairs”); tumen jaka “all things,” “all creations,” “nature” (literally, “ten thousand things” < chin. wanwu “ten thousand things,” “all things on the earth,” “all nature”) (Zakharov, 1879:124; CD).
  The plural of nouns can be formed by repeating the noun; i.e. reduplication: jalan “generation,” “world”—jalan jalan “generations,” “worlds;” se “age,” “year (of age)”—se se “ages,” “years.”
  The combination of two synonyms can also serve to indicate plurality of nouns: baita, sita “matter,” “affair”—baita sita “matters,” “affairs;” gasha, cecike “bird”—gasha cecike “birds;” jergi, hacin “class,” “kind,” “sort”—jergi hacin “classes,” “kinds,” “sorts;” ulin, nadan “goods,” “property,” “possessions,” “wealth”—ulin nadan “riches,” “goods,” “possessions;” ulha, ujime “domestic animal”—ulha ujime “domestic animals” (Zakharov, 1879:123-4; Pashkov, 1963:20). The above-mentioned analytical means of plural formation are analogous with those in the Mongol and Chinese languages.
  When it is necessary to express the plurality of a number of nouns, enumerated one after another, the plural formatives sa/se, ta/te are used, but they only follow the last noun:
  beile beise gung sa-i jergi sira-ra de
  PL-GEN rank inherit-PART DAT beile “prince of the third rank,” beise “prince of the fourth rank,” gung “duke” (NL:27, 114); “When inheriting various ranks such as beile, beise, gung …” (Zakh:124).

Conditional converb: |
  The suffix for the conditional converb is -qi: alaci “when/if one tells;” geneci “when/if one goes;” dosici “when/if one enters.” This form has mostly been considered by manchurologists as the form of the conditional mood (Zakharov, 1879:198). Möllendorff was of the view that this form constituted the conditional tense: araci “I should write,” “if I wrote,” “should I wrote” (Möllendorff, 1892:9). However, as this form may not function as a predicate of a simple sentence, it should not be analyzed as a mood marker. Being a non-finite form, it may serve only as a subordinate predicate in a conditional construction or a clause. Consequently, it is justifiable to include -qi with converbs.
  The conditional converb indicates that the subordinate action precedes the principal action in time. The additional shade of the conditional meaning is what distinguishes the conditional form from the perfect converb. Here are some examples:
  gene-qi uthai gene-mbi seme hendu,
  go-CONV then go-IMPF that say(IMP)
  gene-rakv o-qi, uthai gene-rakv seme hendu
  go-PART(NEG) be(AUX)-CONV then go-PART(NEG) that say(IMP)
  “If (you are intending to) go, then say that (you) will go; if (you are
  not intending to) go, then say that (you) will not go” (ZAKH:199;
  QW);
  muse uka-me tuci-qi sain o-mbi
  we run.away-CONV go.out-CONV good become-IMPF “If we run away it will be good;”
  morphology 279
  si ere ba-de banji-me cihala-qi men’i
  you(SG) this place-DAT live-CONV want-CONV we(EXCL)-GEN
  ere abka-i ba-de sasa banji-ki
  this heaven-GEN place-DAT together live-OPT “If you want to live in this place, (then) live in heaven together with me” (SK:74).
  The verbs aca-“to meet,” “to get together,” “to combine,” “to correspond to,” etc. and o-“to become,” “to be,” being partly desemantized, always require the conditional converb before them. The whole construction has the following meanings: “should,” “ought” or “must” (Tv-CONV aca-“should do smth”):
  bithe-i hafan o-qi, irgen be gosi-me,
  book-GEN official be-CONV, the.common.people ACC cherish-CONV
  giyan be bai-me icihiya-qi aca-mbi
  order ACC seek-CONV manage-CONV AUX-IMPF
  “If (you ) are a civil official, (then) cherishing the common people,
  seeking after order, (you) should manage affairs;”

  tacihiya-me urebu-me, meni meni afa-ha
  train-CONV practice-CONV every fight-PART
  ba-be tuwakiya-qi aca-mbi
  place-ACC guard-CONV AUX-IMPF
  meni meni “every,” “each” (NL:197);
  “If (you) are a military official, (then) training military people, (you)
  should guard every place where (military people) are fighting”

Concessive converb: |
  The concessive converb is formed by the suffix -qibe. Presumably, the suffix -qibe consists of two elements, -qi and be, and the first element -qi has conditional meaning. Another interpretation of the origin of this form is also possible: the conditional stem in -qi is followed by the component be which have concessive meaning. In Turkic languages the concessive forms are formed in a similar fashion. A hypothesis about connection between the suffixes for conditional and concessive meanings has semantic justification since concessive semantics naturally follows from the conditional meaning. 
  The following sentences contain concessive converbs:
  fulun caliyan bi-qibe, inenggidari baitala-rakv
  salary just.enough exist-CONV every.day use-PART(NEG)
  de isi-rakv
  DAT suffice-PART(NEG)
  “There is a salary, but it is not sufficient for day-to-day necessities”
  (ZAKH:206);
  tere juwe niyalma ere ba-de bi-qibe
  that two man this place-DAT be-CONV
  xuwe sabu-rakv o-ho

  morphology 281
  “Although those two men were at this place (here) (they) were not seen at all;”
  nadan aniya tacibu-qibe jinkin’i erdemu be tacibu-rakv
  seven year teach-CONV in.fact skill ACC teach-PART(NEG) “Although studied for seven years, in fact he did not learn any skills” (SK:75).

Desiderative: |
  Desiderative: The form in -qina/-kina is considered to be an imperative form by most specialists (Zakharov, 1879:180-81; Pashkov, 1963:37). The form in -qina/-kina is used by the speaker when he addresses someone who is lower in social position. The accomplishment of the action is considered by the speaker as desirable: alacina (alakina) “speak out (if you wish);” tuwacina (tuwakina) “have a look (if you wish),” etc.
  According to Zakharov, this form originated from the combination of the conditional converb in -qi and the interrogative particle na: -qi + na > -qina. In the author’s opinion, this form expresses a polite request formulated as a question. The meaning rendered by the form in -qina can be translated as the following words and phrases: “please,” “very likely,” “let it be,” “let it be in this way,” “isn’t it so?,” “isn’t it true?”. The word form bicina (the form in -qina derived from the verb bi-“to be,” “to exist”) can be translated as “let it be,” “let it be in this way!,” “isn’t it true?”. The word form secina (the form in -qina derived from the verb se-“to say”) means literally “let me say.” It is very often used as a note of exclamation at the end of an utterance in the meaning “this way it is!,” “so it goes!” (Zakharov, 1879:180-1). Here are some examples:
  uba-de te-qina
  place-DAT live-IMP “Please, live in this place;”
  kemuni ji-qina
  often come-IMP “Please, come often” (ORL:174).
  si ainu hendu-rakv, min-de daljakv you why say-PART(NEG) I(bi/min-)-DAT unconnected.with se-he bi-qina

  soul all fall-IMPF say-IMP “As soon as little children hear the teacher’s voice, all [of them] lose courage [at once], so it goes (literally: let me say)!” (ZAKH:181);
  damu ai emgeri sin-de bai-ki se-he be
  only what one you-DAT ask-OPT say(AUX)-PART ACC
  daha-me, si uthai te-de bu-qina follow-CONV = since you then that(tere)/he-DAT give-IMP “Since he wants to ask you for smth. for the first time, give (it) to him” (PASH2:117); xi ama-i ici emu mudan t’ua-qina (ma. tuwa-qina) you father-GEN toward one time look.at- IMP “Won’t you have a look at your father?” (SK:83).

Perfect converb: |
  The suffix for the perfect converb is -fi: alafi (ala-“to tell,” “to report”); isinafi (isina-“to reach,” “to arrive”); jefi (je-“to eat”); obofi (obo-“to wash”); tefi (te-“to sit,” “to live”). It is the second most widely used converb in Manchu:
  si boo-de isina-fi, majige teye-fi, buda je-fi
  you house-DAT arrive-CONV a.little rest-CONV food eat-CONV
  dere obo-fi jai ji-ki
  face wash-CONV then come-OPT “After you having arrived home, rested a little, eaten a meal, washed (your) face, then come” (ZAKH:191).
  Some verbs have an irregular suffix for the perfect converb, namely -pi or -mpi: juwampi (juwa-“to open”); sampi (sa-“to stretch”); xampi (xa-“to cook dry,” “to drain dry”); wempi (we-“to melt”). Here is an example:
  monggon sa-mpi angga juwa-mpi tuwa-mbi
  neck stretch-CONV mouth open-CONV observe-IMPF “I observe having stretched the neck and opened the mouth” (ZAKH:193).
  These verbs usually take irregular suffixes for the imperfect and perfect participles (-ndara and -ngka respectively).
  The suffix -pi is sometimes used with verbs which have regular perfect participial forms, but in this case it denotes a certain tension of an action or a superlative degree of quality of being or a principal action:
  colgoro-pi geren niyalma ci ujula-me tuci-kebi
  excel-CONV all people ABL head-CONV appear-PAST “Having excelled, he was above all people” (ZAKH:193).
  The perfect converb denotes an action which is completed before another action is undertaken. The dependence between the subordinate action, expressed by the perfect converb, and the principal action, mostly has temporal meaning, for example:
  bithe hvla-ra niyalma bolgo boo-i dolo eici nahan
  book read-PART man clean house-GEN inside or oven-bed
  eici nikeku mulan de te-fi dere-i ninggude
  or chair DAT sit-CONV table-GEN on.the.top.of fi, yuwan, behe hoos an be sinda-fi writing.brush ink-pot Indian.ink paper ACC put-CONV
  bithe be sara-fi tuwa-me hvla-mbi
  book ACC open-CONV look-CONV read-IMPF nikeku mulan “a chair” (NL:212); “A learned scholar, inside a clean room having sat on the oven-bed or the chair, put a writing brush, an ink-pot, Indian ink and a paper on the table, opened a book, (usually) reads” (ZAKH:192);
  tere nadan giyahvn nadan niyalma that seven hawk seven man o-fi sin-i tere ira be become-CONV you(si/sin- SG)-GEN that millet ACC bai-mbi
  look.for-IMPF “Those seven hawks having turned into people, would look for your millet;” ejen tulgide tuci-fi tua-ha (ma. tuwa-ha) khan outside go.out-CONV look-PART “Having gone outside, the khan looked at (smth.)” (SK:72).
  Derived from certain verbs in their auxiliary functions, the perfect converb may indicate the reason for performing an action. Such forms show a tendency to develop gradually into analytical markers of the conjunctive variety. Most Manchu conjunctions originated from such converbal forms (see also Sections specially dedicated to analytical converbal forms and conjunctions, 5.9 & 8.3 respectively):
  si tob sere niyalma o-fi, bi teni uttu tafula-ra
  you upright man be-CONV I then like.this advise-PART
  dabala
  MDL.PTL “I advised you (to do) like this because you are an upright man” (ZAKH:192). According to Zakharov, the verb aina-“to do what?,” “how? how is/are ... ?,” “what’s up?,” “why?” always requires the perfect converbal form from the dependent verb:
  278 part four
  ere-be gisure-fi aina-mbi
  this-ACC speak-CONV do.what-IMPF (literally: “Having said this, do (you) do what?”); “Why do you speak this?” (ZAKH:193). i emgeri sa-fi goida-ha, si kemuni he already know-CONV last.for.a.long.time-PART you(SG) yet
  ala-rakv o-fi aina-mbi
  tell-PART(NEG) be(AUX)-CONV do.what-IMPF “He had already been known (that) for a long time, why haven’t you told (that) yet?” (ZAKH:192).

Perfect participle: |
  The form of the perfect participle in -ha/-he/-ho, -ka/-ke/ -ko, -ngka/-ngke/-ngko is often used to indicate an action which took place in the past. 
  Here are some examples:
  deo bohori elan i ba-de te-he
  younger.brother proper name name of place GEN place-DAT live-PART
  “(His) younger brother Bohori lived in Elan place” (GAB:91);
  juwe di be jafa-ha
  two god ACC take.prisoner/capture-PART “(He) captured two gods (emperors?)” (ORL:176);
  hehe heni tani jobodo-ho
  woman only joke-PART
  heni tani “a bit,” “a little,” “only” (NL:128);
  “The woman was only joking” (NSB:60).
  The majority of specialists ascribe this form to the indicative,
  however, I do not support this view due to the fact that the form is
  a participle in one of its main functions— that of a predicate of a
  simple sentence (see 5.6.1).

  The suffix for the perfect participle is -ha/-he/-ho, and for a small number of verbal stems it is -ka/-ke/-ko: alaha (ala-“to tell”), genehe (gene-“to go”), jodoho (jodo-“to weave”); badaraka (badara-“to expand”), duleke (dule-“to pass,” “to go by”), soroho, soroko (soro-“to turn yellow,” “to avoid as taboo”). According to Zakharov, in Manchu there are 185 verbs ending in -ka/-ke/-ko (87 verbs end in -ka, 81 verbs in -ke and 17 verbs end in -ko) (Zakharov, 1879:174). Even fewer numbers of verbs end in -ngka/-ngke/-ngko: bangka (ba-“to be lazy”), cangka (ca-“to stretch,” “to pitch a tent or yurt”), jengke (je-“to bear,” “to put up with,” “to tolerate”), jongko (jo-“to bring to mind,” “to recall,” “to mention”), jungka (ju-“to clench the teeth”), juwangka (juwa-“to open the mouth”), fungke (fu-“to become numb”), sungke (su-“to freeze”), xangka (xa-“to cook dry,” “to drain dry”), xungke (xu-“to be thoroughly acquainted with,” “to know thoroughly”), wengke (we-“to melt”), yungke (yu-“to have a preference for,” “to be addicted to,” “to absorb (a dye),” “to soak in”).
  In the out-of-case form perfect participles usually act as attributes to nouns or predicates:
  emu mou (ma. moo) i dalba de emu sahal’an (ma. sahaliyan) one tree GEN near DAT one black n’alma (ma. niyalma) be sabu-ha man ACC see-PART “(Someone) saw a black man near a tree;”
  ere abala-me gehe-he gucu-sa ji-ci ai
  this hunt-CONV go-PART companion-PL come-CONV what
  seme ala-mbi
  tell-IMPF ai seme “why?,” “for what reason?” (NL:8); “What will (our) companions, who have gone hunting, tell (us) when they return?” (SK:64).

  The Manchu participles may be followed by markers of the oblique cases when they function as predicates of clauses or objects and adverbial modifiers, either independently or together with dependent words.
  The perfect participles in the dative usually denote actions after which another action starts:
  ajige ju-se damu sefu i jilgan be donji-ha little little.child/son(jui)-PL only teacher GEN voice ACC hear-PART de fayangga gemu tuhe-mbi se-cina
  DAT courage all collapse-IMPF say-OPT “Only boys heard the teacher’s voice all (of them) lost their courage” (ZAKH:181);
  muse ere wakxam-be geli wa-ha de muke inenggidari lakcarakv eye-mbi 
  we this frog(wakxan)-ACC also kill-PART DAT water every.day uninterruptedly flow-IMPF
  “After we kill these frogs water will flow uninterruptedly” (SK:68).
Perfect tense: |
  The form in -habi/-hebi/-hobi and -ngkabi/-ngkebi/-ngkobi.
  This form is used to indicate the past indefinite. As for the origin of
  this form, it seems to originate from two components, the suffix of
  the perfect participle -ha/-he/-ho, -ngka/-ngke/-ngko and the copula
  bi: -habi/-hebi/-hobi < -ha/-he/-ho + bi. Here are some examples:
  malta de oforo i sangga juwe yasa-i sidende banji-habi
  hippopotamus DAT nose GEN hole two eye-GEN in.between become-PAST
  “The nostrils of the hippopotamus were situated between its eyes”
  (ORL:195)10;
  nimanggi i elden de bithe hvla-habi
  snow GEN light DAT book read-PAST “(One) read books by the light (reflected) by snow” (ORL:196);
  absi sin-i coko indahvn be min-i hvla-ra why you(SG)-GEN chicken dog ACC I(bi/min-)-GEN call-PART sasa amasi foro-me gene-hebi
  together backward turn-CONV go-PAST “Why did your chicken and your dog turn back as soon as I called them?” (NSB:59);
  10 The word malta is translated by Norman as “beluga,” “white whale,” “dolphin” (NL:192). Zakharov considered this word as a name for hippopotamus and also for a mythical creature which looks like a hippopotamus (ZAKHL:872).
  juwe dalba-de juwan funce-re haha-si ili-habi
  two side-DAT ten be.in.excess-PART woman-PL stand-PAST “More than ten women stood on both sides” (NSB:134); 
  tere bayan niyalma-i moo olho-me buce-hebi 
  that rich man-GEN tree dry.up-CONV die-PAST “Having dried up, that rich man’s tree died;”
  tere ba-de emu amba gurun’i ejen bi-hebi
  that place-DAT one big state-GEN khan be-PART “In that place the ruler of a big state lived” (SK:79).
  This form has its negative counterpart: alahabi—alahakvbi (ala-“to tell’, “to report”); jihebi—jihakvbi (ji-“to come”); jonohobi—jonohakvbi (jono-“to mention”).
  Since the copula bi without any additional suffixes may be used only as a component of a finite form, its fusing with the suffix of the perfect participle (and the imperfect converb) brought into being the verbal forms which serve as predicates of a simple sentence or a principal clause of a complex sentence.
  In Literary Manchu the copula bi and the participial suffix -ha/ -he/-ho are often written as one, although these are exceptions to this. When the copula bi follows the perfect participle as an independent lexical unit we are dealing with the analytical form of the past tense. In this case one can notice the living relationship between the developing verbal form of the past tense in -habi/-hebi/-hobi and the older analytical form expressed by the construction “the perfect participle + the copula bi.” The copula bi may be replaced by the copula kai which is sometimes written separately from the verb. Thus, instead of the form alahabi the combination alaha kai occurs.
  As finite forms, both the imperfect in -mbi and perfect in -habi/ -hebi/-hobi, are used in the predicate position. When the autonomous component for one of them is expressed by the converb and for the other by the participle, we have every reason to claim that non-finite forms are the oldest in Manchu and that the forms of the indicative mood have developed from converbs and participles.

Stative converb: |
  Stative converb: the converbal form in -hai/-hei/-hoi or -kai/-kei/-koi is used to denote action that is durative and intermittent (for a long time, continually, constantly, permanently); frequentative (often, many times, again and again, repeatedly); or intensive (intently, persistently, steadily). Here are some examples: alahai “telling many times;” jonkoi “reminding again and again, constantly;” tehei aliyambi “someone waits sitting for a long time.” Presumably, this form originated from the perfect participle followed by the marker of the genitive case: -hai/ -hei/-hoi < -ha/-he/-ho + i = GEN. Serving as an adverb of manner in a sentence, the perfect participle was regularly followed by the suffix for the genitive. Gradually, adverbial meaning was assigned to this participial form which shifted its category status from participles to converbs. The newly formed converb preserved the perfective meaning by which the perfect participle was characterized but it gained an additional meaning of duration:
  yasa hada-hai tuwa-mbi
  eye fix.the.eyes.on-CONV look.at-IMPF “(Someone) stares at (smth./smb.) intently” (ZAKH:194); ere bayan n’alma (ma. niyalma) jui tere muke be daha-me this rich man child that river ACC follow-CONV yabu-hai muke i sekin (ma. sekiyen) de ixina-ha (ma. isina-ha) go-CONV river GEN origin DAT reach-PART “That rich man’s son having gone along the river for a long time, reached the source” (SK:76).
  The syntactic construction formed by the imperfect and perfect participles in the genitive followed by the word teile “just,” “only,” “alone” is noted by some authors. The meaning of this construction is rendered as “to the extent of ... ”: mutere-i teile “with all one can,” “with all one’s capabilities,” “to extent of one’s power;” jabduha-i teile “as time permits,” “as opportunity allows”. 
  There are also constructions formed by repeatition of the same stem, where the first component is represented by the perfect participle and the second by the converb: baha bahai “unintentionally” (baha-“to get,” “to obtain”); nambuha nambuhai “at random,” “by chance,” “unintentionally” (nambu-“to catch,” “to have fall into one’s hand”) (Zakharov, 1879:194; NL:22, 209). To substitute meanings that are rendered by this converb, the words emdubei “continually,” “persistently,” “steadily,” “frequently,” “earnestly” and daruhai “often,” “continually,” “regularly” are often used.

Negative Participle Forms: |
  Negative Participle Forms The negative participle is formed by the particle akv which also serves for the negation of the presence of an object or its quality. However, there is formal difference between negative forms of participles and nouns. In the structure of the negative participle the concretion between the participial suffix and the negative particle occurred whereas with nouns the negative particle akv is used as a separate word. 
  Presumably, in the past the negative particle was used with the participle as a separate word too. In Radlov’s records of Sibe, the negative particle is often written separately from the participle, for example: bure akv “(someone) does not give (smth.),” ulhibuke akv “(someone) did not give to know.” It can be conjectured that the negative particle akv preserves its lexical independence when it logically emphasized (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:68). Usually the particle akv is not governed by the law of vowel harmony. However, in classical Manchu in most cases the particle akv is fully fused with the participle into one word: arahakv < araha + akv (ara-“to do,” “to make”); generakv < genere + akv, genehakv < genehe + akv (gene-“to go”); henduhekv < henduhe + akv (hendu-“to say,” “to speak”); ohakv < oho + akv (o-“to become”); sarakv < sara + akv (sa-“to know”), etc.
  Some perfect participles terminating in -ka/-ke/-ko change the consonant k into h in their negative form: jongko + akv > jongkakv/jonghakv (jo-“to recall,” “to mention”); soyoko + akv > soyohakv (soyo-“to shrink,” “to wrinkle”); talmaka + akv > talmahakv (talma-“to be foggy”); tucike + akv > tucihekv (tuci-“to appear,” “to emerge,” “to originate from”). In complex participial forms which are formed by perfect participles derived from autonomous verbal stems and by those derived from auxiliary verbal stems, the negative particle akv is fused with the first component: alahakv bihe, genehakv bihe.
  Instead of an affirmative utterance the Manchus widely used a so-called double negation where the first negative particle is written together with the participles and the second one occurs separately after them: arahakv akv, genehakv akv, sarakv akv (Zakharov, 1879:213-4).
  The negative particle unde “not yet” is normally used after the imperfect participle even when it denotes an action performed in the past: jidere unde “(someone) has not come yet.” Here is a sentence which includes the negative particle “unde:”
  sin-i gisun angga ci tuci-bu-re unde bisi-re-de, i je inu be aifini belhe-me jabdu-ha
  you(SG)-GEN word mouth ABL appear-PASS-PART not.yet be-PART-DAT he yes yes ACC already prepare-CONV complete-PART
  “Although no word has been yet said by you, he has already prepared the answer: yes, exactly!” (ZAKH:215).
  Only the participle is characterized by the opposition between positive and negative forms. Neither verbs nor converbs have negative forms. Therefore, in cases when the negative form of the verb or the converb is required, the negative participle is used.
  
  Negative participles may serve as any part of a sentence, however, they are mostly used as a predicate of a sentence since they may replace the forms of the verb proper. Here are some examples:
  cananggi bu-mbi se-ci bu-hekv, sikse
  previously give-IMPF say-CONV give-PART(NEG) yesterday
  bu-mbi se-ci geli bu-hekv
  give-IMPF say-CONV again give-PART(NEG)
  “Previously (you) said that (you) would give (smth.), but didn’t give;
  yesterday (you) also said that (you) would give (smth.), but again didn’t
  give” (PASH2:131);
  yamji cimari erge-re be bai-rakv
  evening morning rest-PART ACC seek-PART(NEG)
  “(Myself) didn’t seek rest (peace) from morning till evening”
  (PASH2:328);
  ajigen-ci ere i adali fergecuke (ma. ferguwecuke) gaska
  childhood-ABL this GEN like amazing bird
  (ma. gasha) be xue (ma. xuwe) sabu-rakv
  ACC not.at.all see-PART(NEG) “From the childhood (I) have not seen such an amazing bird, not at all;”
  xi (ma. si) ere erin de han’i fuyan o-ho-be
  you this time DAT khan(GEN) wife become-PART-ACC
  dahame mim-be cihala-mbi cihala-rakv
  because I(bi/min-)-ACC love-IMPF love-PART(NEG)
  “Because you became the khan’s wife do (you) love me or not?”
  (SK:69).
  The adverbialization of negative participles frequently occurs due to the fact that negative participles often function as adverbs in a sentence:
  muke inengdari (ma. inenggidari) lakcarakv eye-mbi water every.day uninterruptedly flow-IMPF lakcarakv “uninterruptedly” < lakca-ra akv (lakca-“to break off”) “Water every day will flow uninterruptedly” (SK). The fact that verbs and converbs have no negative forms is additional evidence for the late formation of verbs proper and converbs as compared with the participle.

Substantive Forms of Participles: |
  In the Manchu language the substantive-possessive suffix -ngge which may be attached to both participles, perfect and imperfect (forms in -ha/-he/-ho and -ra/-re/-ro respectively) and to the negative forms of these participles. This suffix does not change its vowel according to the law of vowel harmony. Normally it is written together with participles.
  As mentioned above, from the diachronic point of view, the suffix -ngge was related to the meaning of possession (see Section 2.4.1).
  Following a single participle or a subordinate predicative construction with a participle as a head, the suffix -ngge permits both of them to play the part of a subject or an object in a sentence. I shall use the term “nominalization” to designate the process by which a word of any grammatical class may act (and the result of this acting) in the noun position (see also Section 2.4.1). From the synchronic point of view, the suffix -ngge can rightfully be called a nominalizer.
  The nominalization of participles (and the subsequent process which is substantivization, i.e. the shift of a word to the grammatical class of substantives) has developed in several directions. Participles followed by the suffix -ngge may denote: 1) an abstract notion about an action and can be translated as abstract substantives: aliburangge “presentation of a document to a superior;” bairengge “an application submitted to a superior” or 2) an object which, in its turn, may be of material or immaterial nature: minde buhengge “what was given to me,” “present,” “what you have done,” “a deed,” 3) a subject: “one who says, thinks, etc.,” “those who say, think, etc.”
  Not only affirmative participial forms in -ngge but also their negative
  forms may be characterized by these meanings: akdarakvngge “distrust,” “one who does not trust;” saburakvngge “what is not seen,” “never seen before.”
  In certain cases, participles followed by the suffix -ngge may denote both an abstract action and a person who is characterized according to the action he performs. The difference between these meanings can be understood only from the syntactic context:
  saisa be huwekiyebu-re-ngge
  wise.man/scholar ACC incite-PART-NR “inciting wise men/scholars” or “one who incites wise men/schol-ars;”
  niyamniyam-ra-ngge gabta-ra-ngge
  shoot (arrows).from.horseback-PART-NR shoot.an.arrow-PART-NR
  gemu sain
  all good “Mounted and unmounted shooting are both good;” “One who shoots from horseback and unmountedly is good in all respects” (ZAKH:76).
  Here are some sentences where nominalizations display their different meanings:
  wesi-re forgoxo-ro-ngge umesi hvdun akv
  promote-PART transfer-PART-NR very quick there.is.not
  “Promotions and transferences are very quick” (ZAKH:76); 
  bou (ma. boo) de muda-ci tuci-re-nge (ma. tuci-re-ngge) 
  house DAT return-CONV leave-PART-NR manga (ma. mangga) o-mbi hard be-IMPF “It will be hard to leave (again) after returning home;” 
  yabu-ha-nge (ma. yabu-ha-ngge) yarg’an’i (ma. yargiyani) tondo 
  do-PART-NR indeed honest
  “Our action (what we did) is not honest indeed;”
  ere be muke se-me omi-ha-nge (ma. omi-ha-ngge) gemu araki bi-hebi
  this ACC water say(AUX)-CONV drink-PART-NR everything wine be-PAST
  “Everything that (he) drank thinking it was water was wine” (SK:70).
  A participle construction with a participle as a head, may contain its own subject expressed by a noun in the genitive case:
  age i jombu-re-ngge aisin go i gese gisun kai o-ho
  elder.brother GEN suggest-PART-NR gold jasper GEN like words COP become-PART
  “The elder brother’s words are comparable to gold and jasper (What the elder brother said are the words like gold and jasper)” (Pang, 1986:94); 
  han’i nime-re-nge (ma. nime-re-ngge) majige sain 
  khan-GEN ill-PART-NR a.little good
  “The khan’s illness became a little better” (SK:70).
  The absence of any case markers after participles in the form in -ngge denotes the nominative which normally marks a subject. The marker of the accusative, added to participles, marks an object:
  geren hafa-sa cooha nirgen ere sargan’i jide-re-nge
  many official-PL soldier people this woman(GEN) come-PART-NR (ma. jide-re-ngge) be goroki-ci sabu-fi hendu-me …
  ACC distant.place-ABL see-CONV say-CONV “Many officials and soldiers saw from afar that this woman was coming (this woman’s coming) and said …” (SK:71).
  Direct speech, quotations, hearsay are often introduced with participles in -ngge. In this function participles derived from vebs of speech are mostly used: ala-ra-ngge (ala-“to say,” “to tell”), hendu-re-ngge (hendu-“speak,” “to talk”), se-re-ngge (se-“to say”), fonji-re-ngge (fonji-“to ask”), wesimbu-re-ngge (wesimbu-“to report”). Participles in the form in -ngge are placed before direct speech:
  yuan fai i sargan jui hendu-re-nge (ma. hendu-re-ngge) proper name GEN female child speak-PART-NR
  tere ahvn deo hadan niyalma gemu hvsun amba niyalma
  that elder.brother younger.brother seven man all power big man
  “This is what Yuan Fai’s daughter says: all those seven brothers are powerful and big men;”
  ere fiyanggv sargan jui dobori ere hotun’i (ma. hoton)
  this youngest female child at.night this walled.city(GEN) 
  emu sagda (ma. sakda) mama jakade gene-fi songgo-me ala-ra-ngge
  one old old.woman to go-CONV cry-CONV tell-PART-NR 
  “This is what the youngest daughter who came at night to the city’s old woman tells crying” (SK:71). 
  In the Sibe dialect investigated by Norman, the suffix -nge (-ngge in Manchu) is used as a perfect finite form. This function is common for sentences which express time or place semantics:
  bii beijing-de juwe aniya te-he-ngge 
  I Peking-DAT two year live-(PART-nge) =PERF “I lived in Peking for two years” (Norman, 1974:173).

Desiderative: |
  The suffix for the synthetic form of the desiderative/optative is -ki. This form indicates an action which the person speaking has a desire or an intention to perform or to be performed: bi geneki “I will go” (with the shade of affirmation), si geneki “you would go” (not in the meaning of a strong order but in the meaning of a desire), i geneki “let him/ she go.” Since the optative denotes actions which are not realized, which are to take place in the future, it is inevitably related to the expression of the future. However, the relationship of the optative with the future is a secondary feature which results from the modal nature of this form. That is why the optative forms are often used to indicate the future, and the form in -ki is considered by most specialists as one which denotes the future indicative. When the optative is referred to the second and the third persons (singular and plural) its meaning is very close to that of the imperative. There is a structural reason against analyzing the optative forms for the second and the third persons as the imperative. These forms would become separated from the form for the first person, and the paradigm of the optative would disintegrate. The imperative meaning of the optative occurs only in specific grammatical conditions when reference is made to the second and the third persons. In such cases the imperative meaning arises as additional and secondary to the meaning of the optative. The optative does not possess the category of tense. Here are some examples on the use of the optative:
  muse aca-hakv-ngge kejine goida-ha, bi dosi-fi majige te-ki
  we(INCL) get.together-PART(NEG)-NR a.long.time last.for.a.long.time-PART I enter-CONV a.little sit.down-OPT
  “We have not seen each other fore a long time; I will come in and sit down for a while” (PASH2:191: MOLL:47);
  daritai se min-i sargan jui be older.relative PL I(bi/min-)-GEN=my female child ACC inu majige tuwa-ki
  also a.little see-OPT “Let older relatives also see my daughter” (ORL:172); muse te bou (ma. boo) i baru muda-ki we(INCL) now house GEN towards return-OPT “Let us return home now;”
  xi (ma. si) ere ba-de banji-me cihala-ci
  you(SG) this place-DAT live-CONV wish-CONV
  men’i ere abka i ba-de we(be/men- EXCL)-GEN this heaven GEN place-DAT sasa banji-ki
  together live-OPT “If you wish to live in this place, live together with us in heaven;”
  tere ajige faha be na de caci-ki
  that small seed ACC earth DAT throw-OPT “Throw these small seeds on the earth” (SK:80).

Optative: |
  The form in -kini is used to address a person who is lower in social position. It denotes an order to perform an action immediately: alakini “let him speak” or “allow him to speak;” gaikini “let him take” or “allow him to take;” genekini “let him go” or “allow him to go.” Here are some examples:
  jalan axxa-me jakvn jui sabu-kini
  generation move-CONV eight child see-IMP “Moving generations, let him see eight children;”
  sergvdai ere-ci amasi ninju aniya nimeku akv
  proper name this-ABL after sixty year illness there.is.not
  tanggv aniya targa akv ujun ju-se uji-kini hundred year abstain there.is.not nine child(jui)-PL raise-IMP “Sergvdai, after this, will not be ill for sixty years and will not abstain for a hundred years. Let him raise nine children” (NSB:58).
  According to Zakharov, the form in -kini consists of the suffix of the optative -ki and the interrogative particle ni. It is used in respect to the second or the third persons in order to cause the addressee to act or fulfil a command immediately:
  yabu-bu-kini
  carry.out-PASS-IMP “(They) are ordered to carry out;”
  sin-i ciha i o-kini you(si/sin- SG)-GEN desire GEN be-IMP “Let it be in accordance with your desire” (ZAKH:180); suwe gene-kini, mim-be ume dabu-re you(PL) go-IMP I(bi/min-)ACC NEG press.to.come-PART “You should go, but not press me to come” (ORL:172).
  According to Lebedeva, the form in -kini is used when the person addressed is to cause another person (persons) to perform an action: okini “order him (or them) to become,” gajikini “order him (them) to
  bring.” In her opinion, the suffix -kini consists of two components. The first is represented by the marker of the optative in -ki, and the second component ni indicates the third person. It originated, as in other languages of the Tungus-Manchu family, from the pronoun of the third person in the genetive: i “he” + (n)i > ini. Here are some example:
  hehe n’alma (ma. niyalma) oci gemu deijiku gaji-me woman person TOP all firewood bring-CONV
  ji-kini
  come-IMP “As far as women are concerned, let them come bringing firewood;”
  ere daifu i sargan mergen erdemu be dahame men’i juwe niyalma de sargan o-kini
  this doctor GEN wife wise powerful ACC since we(be/men-EXCL)-GEN=our two man DAT wife be-IMP
  “Since this doctor’s wife is very wise, let her be a wife to both of us” (SK:81).
  
Aorist: |
  This suffix is attached directly to a verbal stem. Zakharov believed that the suffix -mbi is a result of the combination of two elements,
  i.e. the suffix of the imperfect converb -me and the copula bi: -mbi < -me + bi (Zakharov, 1879:173).
  It should be mentioned that there are different opinions about the meaning of this form, and no one is universally accepted. According to some manchurologists, the suffix -mbi is used to express the present tense (Zakharov, 1879:173; Möllendorff, 1892:9). The others consider that the form in -mbi is used to indicate both the present and future therefore it can rightfully be called the form of the present-future tense (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:78). There is an opinion according to which the suffix -mbi is defined as a marker for the aorist, an aspectual-temporal category (Haenisch, 1986:51). D. Sinor considers that the -mbi marker is indefinite. In his opinion, -mbi does not represent the action in time and does not indicate whether the action is accomplished or not (Sinor, 1968:268-9). According to the most widespread point of view, the form in -mbi is considered to be an imperfect finite form (Norman, 1974:168-9). I will refer to this form as the imperfect finite form. 
  The imperfect form has the following grammatical meanings:
  a) it is used to indicate usual and frequentative or abstract actions. This meaning is close to that of the generic time:
  indahvn dobori tuwahiya-mbi, coko erde hvla-mbi
  dog night guard-IMPF chiken early.in.the.morning sing-IMPF “A dog keeps guard at night, a rooster crows early in the morning” (ORL:193);
  muke de do-mbi nimaha je-mbi
  water DAT alight-IMPF fish eat-IMPF “(A bird?) alights on the water, eats fish” (ORL:195);
  inenggi elben gana-mbi, dobori futa muri-mbi
  day thatch take-IMPF night rope weave-IMPF “In the day-time (people) gather thatch, at night (people) weave ropes (usually)” (PASH2:31);
  b) it is used to denote a concrete action which is synchronous to the moment of speech:
  saman hehe ainu yobodo-mbi?
  shaman woman why joke-IMPF
  “Shamaness, why are you kidding around?” (NSB:59);
  si aibi-de gene-mbi?
  you(SG) where-DAT go-IMPF
  “Where are you going to?” (PASH2:2);
  ai baita yabu-mbi?
  what matter do-IMPF “What are (you) doing?” 
  bi tere buhu-i (ma. buha) soko (ma. suku) weihe be gaji-me gene-mbi
  I that bull-GEN pelt horn ACC bring-CONV go-IMPF
  “I am going to bring the pelt and horns of that bull” (SK:78);
  c) the form in -mbi is used to indicate the future tense: jai uttu o-ho-de, bi usha-mbi-kai
  further like.this be-PART-DAT I be.angry-IMPF-MDL.PTL “If it goes on like this, I shall be angry” (ORL:193);
  i inenggi ji-mbi-o jide-rakv-n?
  he day come-IMPF-INT come-PART(NEG)-INT “Will he come to-day or not?”
  urunakv ji-mbi
  certainly come-IMPF “(He) will certainly come” (ZAKH:178);
  tere han-de bi beye aca-me gene-mbi
  that khan-DAT I myself meet-CONV go-IMPF “I myself shall go to meet that khan” (SK:78);
  d) there are some instances when the form in -mbi indicates such action which has been completed prior to the moment of speech and consequences related to this are relevant to the present moment:
  xun dekde-re ergi uce be tuci-mbi
  sun rise-PART side door ACC appear-IMPF “A rising sun has appeared in the doorway” (NSB:70-1).
  The form in -mbi normally serves as a predicate of a simple sentence or a predicate of a principal clause of a complex sentence:
  bi hergen be ara-mbi
  I character ACC write-IMPF “I am writing characters” (ZAKH:159);
  nenden amagan be sa-ha-de, doro de hanci o-mbi
  the.past future ACC know-PART-DAT Tao DAT near become-IMPF “When (you) know the past and the future, (you) will approach to the Tao” (PASH2:30).
  Sometimes the form in -mbi occurs in a subordinate clause when dependence between two events (situations) of the outside world is expressed analytically, by converbal or participial forms of the verb se-“to say” in its auxiliary finction (seme, seci “in order”): 
  bi goro ba-ci ulin buta-mbi seme ji-he
  I distant place-ABL property catch-IMPF say(AUX)-CONV come-PART
  “I came from a distant place in order to gain property (make a fortune);”
  ama jui we ya gene-mbi se-ci ishunde joboco-mbi
  father child who who go-IMPF say(AUX)-CONV each.other worry-IMPF
  “The father and the son are worrying about each other (being unable) to deside which of them will go” (SK:78).
    
Durative hypothetical imperfect tense: |
  The form in -mbihe is used to indicate actions which took place in the past.
  Some specialists specify this tense as the past indefinite: alambihe “(one) told,” genembihe “(one) went;” obombihe “(one) washed”
  Others consider this tense to be the
  past continuous: arambihe “(one) was writing” (Mollendorff, 1892:10).
  Zakharov suggests that this form originated from the imperfect converb in -me derived from an autonomous verb and the perfect participle derived from the verb bi-: -mbihe < -me + bihe. He lists several verb forms: alambihe < alame bihe; genembihe < geneme bihe; obombihe < obome bihe (Zakharov, 1879:174). 
  Here are some examples: 
  malaha boo-de weile-mbihe 
  hat house-DAT make-PAST 
  “(They) made hats (usually) at home;” 
  bi kemuni ere-be niyalma de ere-mbihe 
  I still this-ACC people DAT rely-PAST 
  “I still relied on this man” (PASH1).

Durative simultaneous converb: |
  The imperfect converb is frequently used in combination with different forms of the verb bi-“to be” in its auxiliary function. 
  The functions of such newly created analytical forms require more detailed study, however, we know that they have aspectual-temporal meaning in the first place, as in: ala-me bi-me “telling;” banji-me bi-he “having lived long;” gene-me bi-he “having gone.” 
  The form of the imperfect converb may be fused with grammatical forms of the verb bi- in its auxiliary function, for example: alambime (< ala-me bi-me) “telling;” alambihe (< ala-me bi-he) “having said;” bahambihe (< baha-me bi-he) “having found;” wambihe (< wa-me bi-he) “having killed;” gasambihe (< gasa-me bi-he) “having grieved.” 
  In connection with such forms it should be mentioned that some of them are considered independent converbs, for example, the form in -mbime (Zakharov, 1879:191).

Imperfect converb: |
  Being one of the most commonly used forms in Manchu, the imperfect converb realizes a wide and diverse range of functions. The main meaning of the imperfect converb the suffix for which is -me, is that of simultaneity of both dependent and principal actions. In other words, the converb of this type, as a dependent (non-finite) form, denotes relative tense which, as known, is not related to the moment of speaking but to the tense of the finite form.
  The temporal characteristics of dependent action expressed by the imperfect converb are transmitted to this action from the finite form and from the tense characteristics it possesses. Thus, simultaneity may occur in the past, present, and future.
  Empirical material connected with the functioning of the imperfect converb proves that the hypothesis of broader semantics of simple forms is correct. Thus, the simpler the form is structurally, the more developed system of functions it has (Shamina, 1985:5).
  On the basis of its main meaning, that of simultaneity of both subordinate and principal actions, the imperfect converb develops a wide range of other adverbial meanings, firstly meanings of manner in which another action is performed; condition, cause, and purpose. 
  Here are some examples:
  bithe de foro-me, hergen be tolo-me, yasa tuwa-me gala jori-me urebu-me hvla-mbi
  book DAT turn-CONV letter ACC count-CONV eye observe-CONV hand point-CONV rehearse-CONV read-IMRF
  “Turning toward the book, counting written characters, observing (closely) with eyes, pointing with his hand (finger), (someone) reads (the text) rehearsing” (ZAKH:190);
  muse sibiya makta-me dasame dende-ki
  we(INCL) lots throw-CONV again divide-OPT “Casting lots we shall divide (smth.) again” (ZAKH:191);

  “As Taizong, enlightened emperor, was naturally very wise, [he] propagating disclosed the Heaven’s favours, following up [the same] ideas, increasing valours, spreading [widely], promulgated his enlightened rule” (PASH1:321; literal translation);
  “As Taizong, enlightened emperor, was naturally very wise, he spread the word of Heaven’s favours, and building on these ideas with increasing courage extended his enlightened rule” (literary translation);

  The imperfect converb is commonly used with verbs of motion, phase and modal verbs, and their functions are analogous to those of the Russian infinitive. Here are a few examples of the use of the imperfect
  converb followed by verbs that have semantics of motion. In the following constructions imperfect verbs denote the purpose of an action:

  In combination with verbs of broad semantics, like tuci-“to appear,”
  “to go;” gene-“to go,” “to set off;” ji-“to come,” “to arrive;” gai- “to take;” wa-“to kill” and others, imperfect converbs derived from
  verbs of concrete semantics are used to specify actions of broad semantics.
  Here are the combinations of the imperfect converb with various forms of the verb tuci-: uka-me tuci-he ( running away went out > ran away); ana-me tuci-bu-he (pushing let smb. appear > pushed out).
  The following combinations include the imperfect converb with the verb gai-: uda-me gai-ha (buying took > bought); hvlha-me gai-ha (robbing took > robbed).
  The following combinations consist of the imperfect converb with the verb gene-: amca-me gene-he (running down went > reached); dosime gene-he (entering went > entered).
  Here are the combinations of the imperfect converb with various forms of the verb ji-: suju-me jiu (running come > run [here]); mudame ji-he (returning came > returned).
  The following combinations consist of the imperfect converb and the verb wa-: gapta-me wa-ki (shooting kill > shoot), saci-me wa (killing with a sabre kill > kill with a sabre). Here are some examples:
  emu gucihe o-fi deye-me yabu-ha
  one pigeon become-CONV fly-CONV go-PART 
  “Having turned into a pigeon, (one) flew off (flying off went);” 
  goidahakv abala-me gene-he ilan n’alma (ma. niyalma)

  three man muda-me ji-he mangi (ma. manggi) ere ilan niyalma fonji-me
  return-CONV come-PART after this three man ask-CONV
  “After in a short while three people who had gone hunting returned (returning came back), these three men ask” (SK);
  Combination of the imperfect converbs of synonymous verbs is more frequently used to express a higher level of action intensity:
  gemu songo-me (ma. songgo-me) fa-me men’i men’i everyone cry-CONV sob-CONV 
  each/every bou (ma. boo) i baru muda-ha house GEN to come-PART “Everyone shedding bitter tears (crying, sobbing) went home, each to their own place;” 
  bou (ma. boo) i dosi-ha be tere taitai 
  house GEN fly-PART ACC that mistress 
  sabu-fi umesi urgunje-me bayala-me see-CONV 
  very be.glad-CONV be.happy-CONV 
  “The mistress having seen that (the bird) flew inside the house was very pleased” (SK).

Prefatory converb: |
  The converb in -nggala/-nggele/-nggolo denotes the subordinate action before which the main action takes place. Here are some examples:
  dosi-nggala asuki isibu-mbi
  enter-CONV noise make-IMPF “Before entering (one) makes a noise;”
  gisun waji-nggala yasa-i muke far seme eye-he
  speech finish-CONV eye-GEN water in.large.quantity flow-PART far seme “in large quantity” (NL:83); “Before (one) finished speaking, one’s eyes streamed with tears in large quantity” (ZAKH: 198).
  This converb, like the others, may be derived from certain verbs in their auxiliary function, chiefly from the verb o-“to be,” “to become:” onggolo “before.” All such forms show a tendency to shift to another grammatical class of words, viz. into conjunctions: isitala “up to,” “until;” onggolo “before;” otolo “until;” oci, seci “if;” ofi “because.”

Imperfect participle: |
  The imperfect participle has the suffix -ra/-re/-ro: gene-re (gene-“to go”); ana-ra (ana-”to push”); taci-re (taci-“to learn,” “to study”). There are two irregular participial forms, bisi-re and ojo-ro. The first participle, bisire, is formed from the existential verb bi-“to be,” “to exist” which in this case is used in the irregular form bisi-. All the other forms of this verb are formed from the stem bi-. The stem bisi- may be analyzed etymologically bearing in mind the Evenki participle bisi in which -si is an ancient participial suffix. The same suffix can be found in the Evenki negative auxiliary participle esi. Thus, the Manchu participle bisire has two participial suffixes, the first of them is the ancient suffix -si, analogous to the Evenki suffix -si, and the second one is the contemporary suffix -re. The participle ojoro is etymologically equal to the Evenki verb ojara the structure of which is transparent. The verb ojara is the form of the present tense of the third person, plural, of the verb o-“to become,” where -ja is an aspectual suffix. Since this suffix does not occur among living derivational elements in Manchu, the participle ojoro has a form different from that of other imperfect participles. There are a few more imperfect participles that have irregular forms: jetere (je-“to eat”), jidere (ji-“to come”). A group of imperfect participles have the combinations of elements n+de inserted between the stem and the suffix -ra/-re/-ro: bandara (ba-“to be tired,” “to be lazy,” “to gnaw a hole”); jendere (je-“to bear,” “to put up with,” “to tolerate”); jondoro (jo-“to bring to mind,” “to recall,” “to mention”). Normally such verbs have irregular forms of perfect participles in -ngka/-ngke/-ngko. 
  According to Iv. Zakharov, some verbs have two forms for the imperfect participles, in -ra/-re/-ro and -ndara/-ndere/-ndoro. The latter form denotes progression of the action: akjara “thundering,” akjandara “gradually breaking out in thunder” (akja-“to thunder”); sakdara “ageing,” sakdandara “gradually approaching old age” (sakda-“to get old,” “to age”); were “melting,” wendere “gradually approaching the melted condition” (we-“to melt”) (Zakharov, 1879:186).
  In the out-of-case form the imperfect participle is usually used as an attribute or a predicate:
  si nene-me isinji-ci uthai
  you be.first-CONV come-CONV at.once
  sin-de bu-re you(si/sin- SG)-DAT give-PART 
  “If you come first I shall give (something) back to you straight away;” 
  tuwa-ci uhuri fangga erdemu taci-re bithe bi-hebi
  look-CONV every magic capability learn-PART book be-PAST
  “When (one) had a look (then discovered) that those books were for learning magic” (SK: 65).
  
  The Manchu participles may be followed by markers of the oblique cases when they function as predicates of clauses or objects and adverbial modifiers, either independently or together with dependent words.
  Participles are often used in the dative. The imperfect participles followed by the dative have the meaning of an action which takes place during the time another action is performed or is a result of the completion of that action. Here are some examples:
  baita be deribu-re de, deribun be bodo-mbi
  matter ACC begin-PART DAT beginning ACC think-IMPF 
  “When (someone) begins the matter (he) thinks about (its) beginning (how to begin this matter)” (PASH1:26). 
  mama de ala-ra de, mama hendu-me …
  old.woman DAT tell-PART DAT old.woman say-CONV 
  “When (he) has told to the old woman this old woman says … ;” 
  jabu-re de jugvn de ume jilgan tuci-re 
  go-PART DAT road DAT do.not voice emerge-PART 
  “Going along the road, (you) do not speak” (SK:66).
  The accusative is the second most commonly used marker participles may be followed by. Participles in the accusative usually serve as direct objects which have the meaning of an action or a person who is characterized according to the action he performs:
  in-i mute-re be ala-habi he(i/in-)-GEN be.able-PART ACC say-PAST “(They) said about his ability (to do smth.)” (ZAKH:211);
  ai turgun bisi-re be sa-rkv
  what reason be-PART ACC know-PART(NEG)
  “I am unaware of any reason” (PASH:58);
  muda-me jide-re be jugvn de aca-ha manggi
  return-CONV go-PART ACC road DAT meet-PART after
  “After that (he) met (people who) returning on the road;”
  ere taci-re be ahvn de ulhibu-he akv
  this learn-PART ACC elder.brother DAT inform-PART there.is.not
  “(He) did not inform his elder brother about his learning “ (SK:66).
  Participles in other oblique cases are rarely found. They may be used with marker for the ablative and genitive:
  xun tuci-re ci jabu-me deribu-he
  the sun rise-PART ABL go-CONV begin-PART 
  “After the sun rose (they) started;”
  muse de buce-re ci gvwa arga akv
  we (INCL) DAT die-PART ABL another way there.is.not 
  “There is no other way (to save) us from death” (SK:66).
  
Temeritive apprehensive converb: |
  The analytical form, which consists of the negative form of the imperfect participle in -rahv (-rahv < -ra + akv) and a grammatical form of the verb se-“to say” in its auxiliary function, normally denotes the meaning of apprehension that an action might take place contrary to a desire or expectation. This meaning is very close to that expressed by the following patterns including connecting devices: “(in order) not to do + inf.;” “(so) that ... may not (might) + inf.;” “in order that ... may not (might) + inf.;” “I am afraid that.” The composite morpheme -rahv may be replaced with the participial suffix -ra, but the meaning of the whole analytical form does not change: alarahv sembi, alara sembi “(I) am afraid that (he) might tell.” Sometimes the negative form of the imperfect participle in -rakv in combination with a form of the verb se- are used to produce the same meaning. Here are some examples which express the meaning “anxious expectation:”
  ama eme damu nime-rahv se-me jobo-mbi
  father mother only ill-PART(NEG) say(AUX)-CONV worry-IMPF “I worry that my father and mother might get ill;”
  banuhvn heolen o-jorahv
  lazy negligent become-PART(NEG)
  308 part four
  “(I am afraid) that (lest) (he) might (should) become lazy and negligent” (ZAKH:210);
  gvwa emu baita de gene-ki se-ci, geli
  another one business DAT go-OPT say(AUX)-CONV again
  sim-be ji-de-rakv se-mbi you(si/sin-SG)-ACC come-PART(NEG) say(AUX)-IMPF “(I) wanted to go on another business, but (was afraid) that (lest) you might (should) come (to visit me)” (PASH2:92; QW).
  
  In negative sentences with the functional verb o-, the negative particle
  akv is attached to a participial form of an autonomous verb, whereas
  the morpheme -hv (< akv) occurs with grammatical forms of the verb
  o-in its auxiliary function:
  tuwa-rakv o-jo-rahv
  see-PART(NEG) AUX-PART(NEG)
  “(I am afraid) that (lest) (one) might (should) not see” (ZAKH:211).

adverbials: |
  In Manchu there is another converb formed by the suffix -tai/-tei/-toi, 
  when attached to a verbal stem, this suffix denotes an extreme degree of an action:
  ergele-tei gama-ha
  force-CONV take-PART “(One) took by force;”
  buce-tei afa-mbi
  die-CONV fight-IMPF “(One) fights until death;”
  ejen be weile-re-de beye-be waliya-tai
  emperor ACC serve-PART-DAT self-ACC throw-CONV
  o-me mute-re amban kai
  be(AUX)-CONV be.able-PART high.official COP 
  “When serving the emperor (one) is an official who is able to sacrifice (throw) oneself” (ZAKH:194).

Terminative converb: |
  The terminative/terminal converb in -tala/-tele/-tolo indicates such subordinate action which is going on simultaneously with the principal action. The latter continues until the final completion of the dependent action. Therefore, completion of the subordinate action is that terminal limit up to which the principal action is leading: ala-tala “until telling;” gene-tele “until going;” mana-tala “until full completion,” “until an end” (mana-“to come to an end,” “to diminish”); sakda-tala “till old age, until old.” Here are some examples:
  jing erin o-hobi, geli sin-i boo-de now time become-PAST still you(si/sin- SG)-GEN house-DAT isina-tala baita be tookabu-rakv-n
  arrive-CONV matter ACC delay-PART(NEG)-INT 
  “Now the time has come, while arriving at your house should we still delay the matter?;”
  hvsun moho-tolo
  strength be.depleted-CONV
  “until depleting one’s strength” (ZAKH:197);
  utala aniya o-tolo, heni majige ba-ngkakv
  so.many.as.this year be-CONV at.all a.little be.tired-PART(NEG)
  “So many years have passed, but he has not tired at all” (ZAKH:197);
  muse eigen sargan emu jalan-de dosi-mbu-me sagda-tala banji-mbi 
  we(INCL) husband wife one world-DAT enter-CAUS-CONV get.old-CONV live-IMPF 
  “Until (we) grow old we, the husband and the wife, shall live in the same world;”
  emu bia (ma. biya) o-tolo bou (ma. boo) i dorgi de emhun te-fi
  one month pass-CONV house GEN inside DAT alone sit-CONV
  “Until one month had passed [he] sat at home alone” (SK:76).
  The terminal converb is not used very often in classical Manchu and can be considered an old form. Its use is mainly limited to the syntactic words isitala “up to,” “until” and otolo “till,” “until,” which were originally converbs formed from verbs isi-“to reach,” “to come to,” “to arrive” and o-“to be,” “to become.”
