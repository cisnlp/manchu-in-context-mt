ACCUSATIVE: |
  The marker for ACCUSATIVE is be. Normally, in classical Manchu it is written separately from a word it follows, with the exception of the irregular pronominal stems (see Section 4.1). But there is evidence that the form gisumbe (< gisun “word,” “language” + be) was also in use in old Manchu (Zakharov, 1879:133). 
  The accusative is also considered to be a principal syntactic case marker. Together with the nominative, it is used to mark participants of situations of the outside world. 
  In Manchu, as in other Tungusic languages (and in all Altaic), the expression of the principal syntactic roles is realized through the so-called accusative (nominative-accusative) strategy. That is to say that the case marking of arguments is oriented towards the expression of the opposition between two generalized syntactic roles, namely subject and object. The subject appears in the nominative, and the object is marked by the accusative. In accusative languages, as a rule, the semantic role of experiencer coincides with the role of agent, and the role of patient with that of stimulus (Plungyan, 200:168).
  The main syntactic function of the accusative is to denote a direct complement of the verb. According to this main role in a sentence, the accusative is used to indicate the direct object of a transitive verb.
  In Manchu there is a number of transitive verbs governing the accusative. The corresponding verbs in other languages often may be intransitive. These verbs are: basu-“to laugh at smb., smth.,” “to make fun of,” “to mock at;” daha-“to follow” (the form of the imperfect converb of this verb that is dahame shifted its category status from converbs to postpositions, with the meaning “according to,” “in accordance with”); ejele-“to be master of,” “to occupy by force,” “establish control over;” kadala-“to manage,” “to control,” “to rule;” to kice-“to care about,” “to concentrate on,” “to be intent on;” leole-“to talk about,” “to deliberate (on);” se-“to order,” “to command;” sebjele-“to rejoice at smth.;” uile-“to serve,” “to wait on (upon).” 
  
  In Manchu there are a number of two-placed verbs with mental semantics that govern the accusative. This is unlike other languages having different grammatical systems where certain valencies are filled by nouns in oblique cases: akda-“to depend on,” “to entrust (to),” “to trust;” donji-“to hear about smth.;” gisure-“to speak about smth.,” “to talk about smth;” gvni-“to think about smth., smb.;” hendu-“to speak about smth., smb.” 

  The accusative may indicate the material from which something is made.
  
  The accusative is obligatory when it indicates direct objects governed by transitive verbs in their negative form.
  
  It may serve to indicate an agent caused to perform the action expressed by the verb in the causative.
  
  The accusative may express space within and means of conveyance by which the motion is going on. It is governed by verbs having semantics of motion.

  The accusative may follow participles that serve as predicates in
  clauses which are predicative direct complements. This use of the
  accusative will be analysed in detail in regards to the predicative
  declension of participles (see Section 5.6.3). 
  
  It is very important to note that direct objects are not always indicated
  by the marker for the accusative.
  According to B. K. Pashkov, the use of the accusative marker depends largely on the position of the direct object in a sentence. When a direct object is placed directly before a governing verb, the marker for the accusative can be left out. Any part of a sentence, i.e., subject, indirect object or adverbial modifier of manner may be placed between the direct object and its governing verb. To describe such a position of the direct object, Pashkov introduced into practise the term “distant.” It means that the direct object appears rather far removed in the sentence from the verb that governs it. In such syntactic context the marker for the accusative is obligatory.

  According to Norman, in the important Manchu dialect, Sibe, the accusative is used with direct objects which have definite or specific reference (Norman, 1974:166).
  As far as classical Manchu is concerned, there is no strict explanation as to when the marker of the accusative is obligatory and when it can be omitted, and the problem needs to be fully investigated. Although it is clear that the appearance of the accusative is closely related with the category of definiteness. Several patterns can be distinguished where the accusative is not used in Manchu:
  1) a direct object and a governing verb are formed from the same root and because of that have the same semantics: etuku etu-“to put on clothing” (etuku “clothing;” etu-“to put on [clothing]”); gucu gucule-“to make friends,” “to be friends with” (gucu “friend;” gucule-“to make friends”); irgebun irgebu-“to sing songs,” “to compose verse” (irgebun “song;” “verse;” irgebu-“to sing songs,” “to compose verse”) (GAB:136); ficakv fica-“to blow a flute” ( ficakv “flute;” fica-“to blow [a flute]”); makcin makci-“to dance” (makcin “dance;” makci-“to dance”); nirugan niru-“to paint a picture” (nirugan “picture,” “painting;” niru-“to paint,” “to draw”) (ORL:154).

  2) in a string of direct objects only the last of them is marked by the accusative.
  
  3) direct objects denoting means and ways of conveyance and governed by transitive verbs.
  
  4) in subordinate clauses predicates expressed by participles may
  govern direct objects not indicated by the marker of the accusative.
  
  In Manchu there is a number of two-placed verbs the first valency of which is replaced by the direct object not indicated by the accusative. These verbs are: ara-“to do/make smth. with smth.;” weile-“to make smth. with smth.;” obu-“to consider smb./smth. as smb./smth.;” se-“to call smb./smth. by smb./smth.”
  
  When the verb se- has the meaning “to say,” “to speak,” and the whole construction is used in the meaning of the Latin “accusativus cum infinito,” the marker of the accusative indicates the only position which is replaced by a noun having the meaning of a person or by a personal pronoun.

GENITIVE: |
  The marker for the GENITIVE/INSTRUMENTAL is i, ni. When nouns are changing in accordance with the requirement of the verb, the final -n of the stem is usually deleted. But in the genitive the final -n is preserved. The marker i is used after words ending in a vowel or in -n. Words ending in a consonant other than n, are followed by ni: gurung ni doro “inside the palace” (ZAKH:128). After words anding in i, especially those borrowed from Chinese, the marker for the genitive may be omitted (Möllendorff, 1892:5). There is evidence that in Sibe, if the noun stem has final -ii, then the genitive marker is zero (Norman, 1974:5). In most cases the marker for the genitive is written separately from words it follows: alin i, gisun i, boo i, gurun i, juse i, mujilen i, na
  i. Occasionally words and the marker for the genitive i following them are written as one: abkai ( abka “sky,” “heaven” + i), biyai (biya “moon,”
  “month” + i), booi (boo “house” + i), erei (ere “this” + i), gisuni (gisun “speech,” “word,” “language” + i), hvdai (hvda “business,” “good”
  + i; hvdai ba “market”), hiyalmai (niyalma “man,” “person” + i).
  The genitive is also considered to be one of the principal syntactic cases. Its primary syntactic function is to express an argument which is governed by a noun. Expressing only one, but a very general syntactic relationship between two nouns, the genitive case accumulated a lot of various semantic functions in the Indo-European languages (Benveniste, 1961).
  It should be mentioned that in Turkic languages the use of a subordinate noun without the genitive marker indicates a non-specific interpretation (Plungyan, 2000:186). The primary semantic function of the genitive is the possessive one, according to which it indicates the possessor of an object, its origin and habitation.
  The genitive may also indicate:
  1) part of a whole
  2) material from which a thing is made
  3) quantity, measure, and time
  4) persons according to their kinship and subordination
  5) intention with which a thing (or event) is done
  
  Possessive relations may link an agent and the action this agent
  performs. Possessive relations may also link a patient and the current
  state of the patient (or the change the patient undergoes) as well as
  an experiencer and the action of perception of visual or auditory
  information. In this case, the marker of the genitive follows a word
  which denotes a subject of clauses of certain kinds
  
  The attributive function, in its broadest sense, has developed from the possessive function, which is the primary semantic meaning of the genitive. Nouns followed by the marker of the genitive normally serve as attributives in a sentence: doro-i umiyesun “a belt for a court dress or ceremonial garment;” rite-GEN belt doro-i yoro “a ceremonial arrow” (NL:63); rite-GEN arrow
  dorolon i nomun “the book of rites” (PASH1:76); rite GEN classic.book urgun i cira “a merry/lively face” (ZAKH:128); joy GEN face
  
  Occurring after nouns with semantics of objects, the genitive is used
  in combinations of word which become fixed nominal units

  In Manchu, one sentence may include a sequence of attributes in one noun phrase when attributes ascribe certain qualitative characteristics to the preceding attributes:
  
  The genitive is used to attribute qualitative chatacterictics not only to nouns, but to participles and verbs as well. Occurring after nouns having qualitative semantics, the genitive indicates the adverbial modifier of manner:
  
  Adverbs are normally formed by repeating the noun followed by the genitive marker: cun cun i “gradually;” dahvn dahvn i “repeatedly”
  (dahvn “again”); giyan giyan i “in proper order” (giyan “order,” “proper”); siran siran i “continually” (siran “continuation”); ulhiyen ulhiyen i “gradually” (ulhiyen “gradual”) (ZAKHL, NL). The genitive may also denote the following additional meanings:
  
  In Manchu, nouns are normally followed by the genitive before a
  number of postpositions. The genitive marker does not in this case
  express a certain kind of a relation between the noun and the
  postposition, it merely serves is a formal link between them. Here
  are some examples where the genitive marker serves as a formal
  device linking a noun and a postposition following it.

DATIVE: |
  The marker for the DATIVE/LOCATIVE is -de. Like the accusative, the dative does not follow the law of vowel harmony. In most cases the marker of the dative is written separately from the word it follows, with several exceptions to the rule. The marker and irregular forms of personal pronouns are normally written as one. The marker de and the copula bi are also written as one in the following patterns: amargi debi “it is situated in the north;” dergi debi “it is situated in the east;” julergi debi “it is situated in the south;” wargi debi “it is situated in the west.”
  Like the accusative, the dative plays a very important role in the structure of Manchu utterances. Although the dative is oriented towards the expression of the peripheral semantic roles of arguments, it is used to express many of these. The dative is primarily used to indicate the semantic role of recipient, which is normally combined together with the role of addressee and in some languages with the semantic roles of benefactive and experiencer. All of these semantic roles are generalized by the case for the syntactic indirect object,
  i.e. the dative (Plungyan, 2000:169-70). The semantic role of instrument, which is considered to be a peripheral argument, is also marked by the dative in Manchu. Being a polyfunctional case, the dative is used in Manchu to indicate circumstantial semantic roles, primarily, to express space and temporal relationships. Correspondingly, the dative has two basic syntactic functions: it is used to indicate an indirect object and adverbial modifier, mostly of place and, less frequently, time and cause.
  Indicating an indirect object, the dative refers to the recipient of the action or the addressee of speech or another action.
  
  The dative may indicate the agent of a passive verb.
  The dative may indicate a person who is the possessor of something. A predicate of such a sentence is expressed by the verb bi-“to be,” “to exist” (or by the copula bi), which takes the meaning “to have,” “to possess” in such constructions as following:
  
  The dative may indicate parenthetical words denoting the source
  of a statement (dictum) or quotation
  
  The dative also indicates an instrument of the action
  
  The dative is used when people talk about someone else’s activities.

  Serving as an adverbial modifier of place, time, and cause the dative may show:
  1) location in space (in, at)
  2) destination (towards, upon, on)
  3) location in time (it should be mentioned that in a simple sentence
  an adverbial modifier of time is more often expressed by the
  nominative)
  4) the limits of a certain length of road or space of time (from... to, from ... until)
  5) as far as the temporal meaning of the dative is concerned, it is mostly found in complex sentences, in clauses expressing semantics of time. Following participles, the dative indicates a general temporal meaning
  6) the dative may indicate an adverbial modifier of manner: jobolon de “sorrowfully,” urgun de “joyfully,” doron de “according to rites,” “ceremonially;”
  7) cause
  
  The dative is usually governed by nouns and verbs having semantics
  of evaluation such as ja “easy,” mangga “difficult,” sain “well,” amuran “fond of,” “intent on,” duibule-“to compare,” etc.
  
  The dative is also governed by the following verbs: aca-“to meet,” “to meet together,” “to correspond to,” “to fit,” “to be equal;” aliya-“to wait;” bai-“to ask for;” donji-“to listen,” “to hear;” fonji-“to ask;” holbo-“to get married;” isina-“to reach;” taci-“to learn,” “to study,” “to become accustomed to.”
  
  In Manchu, many nouns are changed into syntactic words, mostly postpositions, by the attachment of the dative marker. The nouns themselves show a tendency to lose their lexical meaning, becoming partly desemanticized. Some of these words can serve as conjunctions in complex sentences.
  The following postpositions occur quite frequently: bade “if,” “in the case that” (ba “place,” “occasion,” “reason,” “condition”); dade “in addition to” (da “root,” “base,” “foundation”); erinde “when” (erin “time”); fonde “when” (fon “time”); jakade “to the presence of,” “up to,” “by,” “in front of” (jaka “thing,” “object”); jalinde “for the sake of” (jalin “reason,” “motive”); sidende “in between” (siden “space,” “interval”); turgunde “because,” “since” (turgun “reason,” “motive”). Syntactic functions of these words will be described in more detail in chapters dedicated to postpositions and conjunctions (see 8).
  Finally, if there are several homogeneous parts of the sentence to be indicated by the dative marker, only the last one is actually marked.

ABLATIVE: |
  The marker for the ABLATIVE is -qi. The ablative is grouped together with the so-called locative cases which are used to express space relationships. The ablative is used to indicate adverbial modifiers which denote the starting point in space or in time. In accordance with this basic function, the ablative displays the following syntactic meanings:
  1) it indicates a starting point in space
  2) a starting point in time
  3) a starting point of a length of road or space of time in constructions of the type “from ... to,” “from ... until”
  4) the meaning of separation
  5) the ablative marks an object with which something is compared (an object of comparison)
  6) the ablative has distributive meaning
  
  In Manchu, the ablative is governe d by the following verbs: fakca-“to leave,” “to separate;” alja-“to leave;” tuci-“to come out,” “to go out,” “to emerge,” “to appear:”
  
  The postposition tulgiyen “besides” also governs the ablative

PROLATIVE: |
  As for the deri-form in classical Manchu, scholars who consider it
  case marker differ in specifying its meaning. Those who recognize
  deri as a case often use different terms to designate it.
  According to Zakharov, the marker deri can be used instead of the marker of the ablative ci (Zakharov, 1879:136).
  
  G. Kiyose used the term “prolative” to designate the deri-case form (Kiyose, 1997:150). J. Norman classified the deri-form together with the ci-form as the ablative for classical Manchu (Norman, 1974:165). As far as Sibe is concerned with respect to these two locative cases, the distribution of meaning between the case markers ci and deri suggested by Norman is different from the meaning these markers have in Radlov’s texts. There ci is used to denote one of the functional variants of the ablative, with the main meaning of a starting point (in space or in time), and deri corresponds roughly to the separative
  case (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:49). There are a number of instances where deri is used in comparative constructions.

derivative suffix used to form nouns of quality: |
  Nominal words of quality may be derived from object nouns by the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo: boconggo “coloured,” “colourful” (boco “colour”); erdemungge “virtuous,” “talented,” “moral” (erdemu “capability,” “virtue,” power”); gosingga “beloved,” “compassionate,” “cherished,” “loving,” “merciful” (gosin “mercy,” “pity,” “love”); horonggo, horonggu “powerful,” “majestic,” “possessing great authority” (horon “power,” “majesty,” “authority”); moringga “pertaining to the horse,” “mounted;” “horseman,” “rider” (morin “horse”). The final -n of a stem is deleted before the addition of the suffix -ngga/-ngge/ -nggo. According to Iv. Zakharov from whose grammar some examples are taken, the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo is the only one by which the proper adjective forms of the nouns, having semantics of quality, are formed in Manchu (Zakharov, 1879:77-8).
  There is another point of view concerning the nature of this suffix. According to E.P. Lebedeva, originally the suffix -ngga/-ngge/-nggo was used to mark possession. It may be attached to both semantic groups of nouns, viz. to those having the meaning of object in the broad sense and those having semantics of quality: ujungga “first,” “leading” (uju “head,” “first”); ubungge “pertaining parts, portions or shares” (ubu “part,” “portion,” “share,” “responsibility”); hacingga “with distinctions,” “different/various (kinds)” (hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item”); hvsungge “powerful,” “mighty” (hvsun “strength,” “power,” “might”); baitangga “business,” “necessary” (baita “matter,” “affair,” “business,” “event”), enduringge “divine,” “holy,” “sacred” (enduri “spirit,” “god,” “deity”), etc. Some of these nouns taking on   a new qualitative meaning reveal a tendency to shift their category status from object nouns to the class of adjectives: baitangga, boconggo, horonggo, hvsungge.

Plurals: |
  The most commonly used suffixes for plurals (or more properly collectives) are -sa/-se/-so, -ta/-te, -si and -ri.
  The suffixes -sa and -se are used with nouns denoting age, generation and relatives (kinsmen and kinswomen): ecike “father’s young brother (uncle)”—ecikese “father’s young brothers (uncles);” gege “elder sister” (also a respectful term of address to young ladies)— gegese “elder sisters;” jui “son,” “child”—juse “sons,” “children;” sadun “father of the son-in-law,” “father of the daughter-in-law”—sadusa “fathers of the son-in-law, the daughter-in-law;” sagda “old man”— sagdasa “old men”2.
  These suffixes are also used with nouns denoting peoples and nations, posts, ranks, titles and occupations: age “prince, son of an emperor” (also a polite term of address, master, sir, lord)—agese “princes, sons of an emperor” (also sirs, masters); amban “high official”—ambasa “high officials,” antaha “guest”—antahasa “guests;” bayan “rich man”—bayasa “rich men;” beile “ruler,” “prince of the third rank”—beile se “rulers,” “princes;” faksi “craftman,” “workman”—faksisa “craftmen,” “workmen;” gucu “friend”—gucuse “friends;” hafan “official,” “officer”—hafasa “officials,” “officers;” han “khan,” “emperor”—han sa “khans,” “emperors;” irgen “people,” “nation”—irgese “peoples,” “nations;” lama “lama,” “monk”—lamasa
  “lamas,” “monks;” manju “Manchu”—manjusa “the Manchus;” nikan “Chinese”—nikasa “the Chinese;” oros “Russian”—oros se “the Russians;” xabi “pupil,” “student”—xabisa “pupils,” “students”3. The suffix -so is found in the names of peoples and nations: monggo “Mongol”—monggoso “the Mongols;” solho “Korean” – solhoso “the Koreans;” also gioro “the name of the Manchu dynasty clan”—gioro so (in old Manchu books it was often used in the form gioro se); giohoto “beggar”—giohoto so “beggars.”
  The suffix -si is used with some nouns denoting age, relative relationships and status of human beings: aha “slave”—ahasi “slaves;” haha “male,” “man”—hahasi “males,” “men” (the polite plural form haha niyalma); hehe “female,” “woman”—hehesi “females,” “women” (the polite plural form hehe urse); hojihon “son-in-law”—hojihosi “sons-in-law;” omolo “grandson”—omosi “grandsons.”
  The suffixes -ta and -te are used with words denoting the age of human beings, generation and relatives: ahvn “elder brother”—ahvta “elder brothers;” ama “father”—amata “fathers;” ambu “mother’s elder sister”—ambuta “mother’s elder sisters;” amji “father’s elder brother”—amjita “father’s elder brothers;” amu “father’s elder sister”—amuta “father’s elder sisters;” asihan “young man”—asihata “young men;” axa “elder brother’s wife”—axata “elder brother’s wives;” efu “the husband of one’s elder sister,” “wife’s elder brother,” “the husband of wife’s elder sister” – efute “husbands of one’s elder sister,” “wife’s elder brothers,” “husbands of wife’s elder sister;” eigen “husband”—eigete “husbands;” ejen “ruler,” “lord,” “master,” “emperor”—ejete “rulers,” “lords,” “masters;” eme “mother”—emete “mothers;” eshen “father’s younger brother (uncle)”—eshete “father’s younger brothers (uncles);” eyun “elder sister”—eyute “elder sisters;” da “foreman”—data “foremen;” dehema “husband of mother’s sister (uncle)”—dehemata “husbands of mother’s sister (uncles); deheme
  3 The plural suffix -se should be distinguished from the morpheme -se which some Chinese loan words contain. In the Chinese borrowings the morpheme -se (in Manchu transcription) represents the Chinese morpheme -zi: ma. cise “pond” < chin. chizi; ma. dangse “register” < chin. dangzi; dengse “steelyard” < chin. dengzi; kose “pants,” “trousers” < chin. kuzi; pase “a rake” < chin. pazi; panse “plate,” “tray” < chin. panzi; tangse “the imperial shamanic shrines in Peking and Mukden” < chin. tangzi ( Zakharov, 1879:121; CD). Norman translates the word panse as “chessboard,” “measure for games of chess” (NL:226).
  “mother’s younger sister (aunt)”—dehemete “mother’s younger sisters (aunts);” deo “younger brother”—deote “younger brothers;” ge “husband’s elder brother”—gete “husband’s elder brothers;” gu “father’s sister”—gute “father’s sisters;” gufu “husband of father’s sister”—gufute “husbands of father’s sister;” meye “younger sister’s husband “—meyete “younger sister’s husbands” (in old language this word also meant “wife’s younger brother”—NL:197); nakcu “mother’s brother”—nakcuta “mother’s brothers” (also nakcusa, nakcuse); naca “wife’s elder brother”—nacata “wife’s elder brothers;” non “younger sister”—nota “younger sisters;” oke “the wife of father’s younger brother”—okete “wives of father’s younger brother;” sargan “wife”— sargata “wives” (also sargasa); uhume “father’s younger brother’s wife”
  – uhumete “father’s younger brother’s wives;” ungga “the elder in generation”—unggata “elders in generation” (Zakharov, 1879:120-3; Pashkov, 1963:19-20).
  Suffix -ri occurs only with a few words: mafa “grandfather”—mafari “grandfathers,” mama “grandmother”—mamari “grandmothers.” Both words are also used in the meaning “ancestors,” “forefathers.”
  One can see that some words are used with various plural suffixes: agu = a respectful term of address for men: sir, master—agusa, aguse; nakcu “uncle (mother’s brother)”—nakcusa, nakcuse, nakcuta “uncles (mother’s brothers);” sargan “wife”—sargasa, sargata “wives;” urun “daughter-in-law,” “sister-in-law”—urusa, uruse “daughters-in-law,” “sisters-in-law.”
  There is no strict rule governing whether the plural suffix should be written together with a noun stem or separately (for instance: beile se, han sa, oros se). But in most cases the plural suffix and a noun stem are written as one word.
  It should be noted that final -n, -i and -lo are deleted in some words before the addition of the plural suffix: amban “high official,” “dignitary”—ambasa “high officials;” jui “son,” “child”—juse “sons,” “children;” omolo “grandson”—omosi “grandsons.”
  composite suffixes coincide with those which can be found in collective nouns, numerals, and other parts of speech in Tungusic. In collective nouns, these suffixes convey the meaning of various groups of people or collections of objects which are the results of human activities. In plurals formed by the composite suffixes in which a morpheme for collectivity and a morpheme for plurality have merged, the idea concerning human society, the tribal system, clans and kindred groups of people becomes more emphasized. The archaic character of this group of nouns, its isolation from the others and, more importantly, the fact that it denotes the collective and comitative meanings, all leads to the conclusion that historically a grammatical category conveying the collective meaning preceded the grammatical category of plurality in Tungusic. As far as Manchu is concerned, it is difficult to ascertain whether the language had lost the suffix -l denoting plurality in Tungusic, with the exception of Udeghe and Oroch, or had never had it (Tzintzius, 1946:73-119).
  In Manchu, the suffix -sa/-se had the collective meaning in the past. The moribund collective morpheme -se can be found in the Manchu word urse “people.” This suffix corresponds to the Ude word se “clan (a group of persons originating from a male ancestor and united by recognition of their blood relationship),” “nationality,” “family,” “kind,” “sort,” “type.” In its turn the Ude word se is a part of a semantic group of words related to the word “blood” in Tungusic: evenk. sekse, neg. sakse, oroch. saksa, ud. sake, ulch. sekse, nan. sekse, ma. senggi; also neg. senggi “relatives by marriage;” ma. senggi o-“to drink blood,” senggile-“ to act in a bloody manner;” senggileme afa-“to fight a bloody battle;” senggime “bloody,” “love between brothers;” “kindred love;” “intimite,” “friendly,” “on good terms.”
  The Manchu suffix -ta/-te corresponds to various pronominal elements in Tungusic: the Manchu-Tungus demonstrative pronoun ta-/te-“that,” personal pronoun for the third person, plural ta-/te-“they,” possessive suffix for the third person, plural -tan/-ten in Even (Lamut) and -tin in Evenki.
  It is more difficult to determine the origin of the suffix -ri since there are no words beginning with r in the Manchu-Tungus languages (and in general, in Altaic). It probably corresponds to the same component found in the Tungusic demonstrative pronouns: even., evenk. e-r, e-ri, e-re “this;” ta-r, ta-ri, ta-ra “that.” This suffix is not widely spread.
  Tzintzius came to the conclusion that grammatical categories denoting collective and comitative meanings preceded the grammatical category of plurality in the Tungus-Manchu languages. These categories originated from pronouns, collective nouns, and names of human groups, that is nation, people, clan, tribe (Tzintzius, 1946:73-119).
  In Manchu, the plural may be formed analytically, by adding words denoting collective meaning or plurality. Some of these words like eiten “all,” “every;” geren “all,” “many,” “numerous,” “the various …;” yooni “all,” “all together,” “complete,” “entire;” labdu “many,” “much;” ududu “some,” “several,” “many,” “a number of,” normally precede nouns. Here are some examples: eiten jaka “everything,” “every object;” geren niyalma “all/many men/persons.” The word geren is also used in combination with plural forms: geren ambasa hafasa “many officials;” geren xabisa “many pupils,” “many students.” This is a single case when synthetic means of expressing plurals combine with an analytical one (pleonasm).
  Other words having the same semantics, such as gemu “all,” tome “every,” each,” always follow nouns: bayan gemu “all rich men;” gurgu tome “ every wild animal;” irgen gemu “all people;” moro tome “every bowl;” niyalma tome “every man/person,” “people;” yadahvn gemu “all poor men” (Pashkov, 1963:20).
  Plurality may be expressed by adding generic words denoting the biological class of living beings: gasha “bird,” gurgu “wild animal,” “beast;” niyalma “man,” “person;” ulha “domestic animal,” urse “men,” “people,” “persons.” The word urse chiefly follows nouns of quality or participles: bayan urse “rich men;” ehe urse “the villains;” tacire urse “the scholars” (taci-re = taci-“to learn” , “to study” + -re , the suffix for the imperfect participle). The words hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item” and jergi “class,” “degree,” “group,” “rank” should be included in this group. All these words are placed after the relevant nouns.
  Plurality can be expressed with the help of the words hacin “kind,” “sort,” “class,” “item” and jergi “category,” “grade,” “rank,” “sort.” Following the marker for the genitive case added to the noun, these words denote both plurality of objects and the belonging of the latter to a certain class, kind or sort. Following the noun directly, they denote plurality with the shade of meaning “of different/various kinds, every kind.” The word jergi is normally used with animate objects and the word hacin with inanimate objects. Here are some examples: baita hacin “different/various matters/affairs;” giyahvn jergi
  gasha “falcons, hawks and other related birds;” gurgu jergi “different/ various wild animals,” “animal world;” kooli hacin “regulations and precedents;” orho hacin “herbs,” “plants;” tasha jergi gurgu “the tigers and other related beasts;” tasha i jergi gurgu “beasts belonging to the tiger family;” tubihe hacin “fruits” (Zakharov, 1879:123).
  In Manchu, special combinations consisting of two words are used to denote the collective meaning. The first word is represented by a cardinal number which is an attribute to the following noun. Such combinations originated from the Chinese patterns: duin ergi “the four corners of the world” (literally, “the four sides” < chin. sifang “(four) all sides,” “(four) all quarters”); duin mederi “the whole country,” “all kingdoms,” “the whole world” (literally, “the four seas washing the earth” < chin. sihai “the four seas,” “the whole country,” “the whole world” ); sunja hacin i jeku “cereals” (literally, “five kinds of cereal” < chin. wugu “the five cereals: rice, two kinds of millet, wheat and beans”); tanggv hafan “the officials” (literally, “one hundred officials” < chin. baiguan “one hundred officials,” “the officials” ); tanggv hala “people” (literally,”one hundred families” < chin. baixing “one hundred family names,” “common people”); tumen baita “a great number of affairs” (literally, “ten thousand affairs” < chin. bainshi “a hundred affairs,” “all kinds of affairs,” “numerous affairs”); tumen jaka “all things,” “all creations,” “nature” (literally, “ten thousand things” < chin. wanwu “ten thousand things,” “all things on the earth,” “all nature”) (Zakharov, 1879:124; CD).
  The plural of nouns can be formed by repeating the noun; i.e. reduplication: jalan “generation,” “world”—jalan jalan “generations,” “worlds;” se “age,” “year (of age)”—se se “ages,” “years.”
  The combination of two synonyms can also serve to indicate plurality of nouns: baita, sita “matter,” “affair”—baita sita “matters,” “affairs;” gasha, cecike “bird”—gasha cecike “birds;” jergi, hacin “class,” “kind,” “sort”—jergi hacin “classes,” “kinds,” “sorts;” ulin, nadan “goods,” “property,” “possessions,” “wealth”—ulin nadan “riches,” “goods,” “possessions;” ulha, ujime “domestic animal”—ulha ujime “domestic animals” (Zakharov, 1879:123-4; Pashkov, 1963:20). The above-mentioned analytical means of plural formation are analogous with those in the Mongol and Chinese languages.
  When it is necessary to express the plurality of a number of nouns, enumerated one after another, the plural formatives sa/se, ta/te are used, but they only follow the last noun:
  beile beise gung sa-i jergi sira-ra de
  PL-GEN rank inherit-PART DAT beile “prince of the third rank,” beise “prince of the fourth rank,” gung “duke” (NL:27, 114); “When inheriting various ranks such as beile, beise, gung …” (Zakh:124).

Conditional converb: |
  The suffix for the conditional converb is -qi: alaci “when/if one tells;” geneci “when/if one goes;” dosici “when/if one enters.” This form has mostly been considered by manchurologists as the form of the conditional mood (Zakharov, 1879:198). Möllendorff was of the view that this form constituted the conditional tense: araci “I should write,” “if I wrote,” “should I wrote” (Möllendorff, 1892:9). However, as this form may not function as a predicate of a simple sentence, it should not be analyzed as a mood marker. Being a non-finite form, it may serve only as a subordinate predicate in a conditional construction or a clause. Consequently, it is justifiable to include -qi with converbs.
  The conditional converb indicates that the subordinate action precedes the principal action in time. The additional shade of the conditional meaning is what distinguishes the conditional form from the perfect converb. 
  
  The verbs aca-“to meet,” “to get together,” “to combine,” “to correspond to,” etc. and o-“to become,” “to be,” being partly desemantized, always require the conditional converb before them. The whole construction has the following meanings: “should,” “ought” or “must” (Tv-CONV aca-“should do smth”)

Concessive converb: |
  The concessive converb is formed by the suffix -qibe. Presumably, the suffix -qibe consists of two elements, -qi and be, and the first element -qi has conditional meaning. Another interpretation of the origin of this form is also possible: the conditional stem in -qi is followed by the component be which have concessive meaning. In Turkic languages the concessive forms are formed in a similar fashion. A hypothesis about connection between the suffixes for conditional and concessive meanings has semantic justification since concessive semantics naturally follows from the conditional meaning. 
  
Desiderative: |
  Desiderative: The form in -qina/-kina is considered to be an imperative form by most specialists (Zakharov, 1879:180-81; Pashkov, 1963:37). The form in -qina/-kina is used by the speaker when he addresses someone who is lower in social position. The accomplishment of the action is considered by the speaker as desirable: alacina (alakina) “speak out (if you wish);” tuwacina (tuwakina) “have a look (if you wish),” etc.
  According to Zakharov, this form originated from the combination of the conditional converb in -qi and the interrogative particle na: -qi + na > -qina. In the author’s opinion, this form expresses a polite request formulated as a question. The meaning rendered by the form in -qina can be translated as the following words and phrases: “please,” “very likely,” “let it be,” “let it be in this way,” “isn’t it so?,” “isn’t it true?”. The word form bicina (the form in -qina derived from the verb bi-“to be,” “to exist”) can be translated as “let it be,” “let it be in this way!,” “isn’t it true?”. The word form secina (the form in -qina derived from the verb se-“to say”) means literally “let me say.” It is very often used as a note of exclamation at the end of an utterance in the meaning “this way it is!,” “so it goes!” (Zakharov, 1879:180-1). Here are some examples:

Perfect converb: |
  The suffix for the perfect converb is -fi: alafi (ala-“to tell,” “to report”); isinafi (isina-“to reach,” “to arrive”); jefi (je-“to eat”); obofi (obo-“to wash”); tefi (te-“to sit,” “to live”). It is the second most widely used converb in Manchu:
  
  Some verbs have an irregular suffix for the perfect converb, namely -pi or -mpi: juwampi (juwa-“to open”); sampi (sa-“to stretch”); xampi (xa-“to cook dry,” “to drain dry”); wempi (we-“to melt”). Here is an example:
  These verbs usually take irregular suffixes for the imperfect and perfect participles (-ndara and -ngka respectively).
  The suffix -pi is sometimes used with verbs which have regular perfect participial forms, but in this case it denotes a certain tension of an action or a superlative degree of quality of being or a principal action:
  
  The perfect converb denotes an action which is completed before another action is undertaken. The dependence between the subordinate action, expressed by the perfect converb, and the principal action, mostly has temporal meaning, for example:
  
  Derived from certain verbs in their auxiliary functions, the perfect converb may indicate the reason for performing an action. Such forms show a tendency to develop gradually into analytical markers of the conjunctive variety. Most Manchu conjunctions originated from such converbal forms (see also Sections specially dedicated to analytical converbal forms and conjunctions, 5.9 & 8.3 respectively):

Perfect participle: |
  The form of the perfect participle in -ha/-he/-ho, -ka/-ke/ -ko, -ngka/-ngke/-ngko is often used to indicate an action which took place in the past. 
  
  The majority of specialists ascribe this form to the indicative,
  however, I do not support this view due to the fact that the form is
  a participle in one of its main functions— that of a predicate of a
  simple sentence.

  The suffix for the perfect participle is -ha/-he/-ho, and for a small number of verbal stems it is -ka/-ke/-ko: alaha (ala-“to tell”), genehe (gene-“to go”), jodoho (jodo-“to weave”); badaraka (badara-“to expand”), duleke (dule-“to pass,” “to go by”), soroho, soroko (soro-“to turn yellow,” “to avoid as taboo”). According to Zakharov, in Manchu there are 185 verbs ending in -ka/-ke/-ko (87 verbs end in -ka, 81 verbs in -ke and 17 verbs end in -ko) (Zakharov, 1879:174). Even fewer numbers of verbs end in -ngka/-ngke/-ngko: bangka (ba-“to be lazy”), cangka (ca-“to stretch,” “to pitch a tent or yurt”), jengke (je-“to bear,” “to put up with,” “to tolerate”), jongko (jo-“to bring to mind,” “to recall,” “to mention”), jungka (ju-“to clench the teeth”), juwangka (juwa-“to open the mouth”), fungke (fu-“to become numb”), sungke (su-“to freeze”), xangka (xa-“to cook dry,” “to drain dry”), xungke (xu-“to be thoroughly acquainted with,” “to know thoroughly”), wengke (we-“to melt”), yungke (yu-“to have a preference for,” “to be addicted to,” “to absorb (a dye),” “to soak in”).
  In the out-of-case form perfect participles usually act as attributes to nouns or predicates:
  
  The Manchu participles may be followed by markers of the oblique cases when they function as predicates of clauses or objects and adverbial modifiers, either independently or together with dependent words.
  The perfect participles in the dative usually denote actions after which another action starts.

Perfect tense: |
  The form in -habi/-hebi/-hobi and -ngkabi/-ngkebi/-ngkobi.
  This form is used to indicate the past indefinite. As for the origin of
  this form, it seems to originate from two components, the suffix of
  the perfect participle -ha/-he/-ho, -ngka/-ngke/-ngko and the copula
  bi: -habi/-hebi/-hobi < -ha/-he/-ho + bi. 
  
  This form has its negative counterpart: alahabi—alahakvbi (ala-“to tell’, “to report”); jihebi—jihakvbi (ji-“to come”); jonohobi—jonohakvbi (jono-“to mention”).
  Since the copula bi without any additional suffixes may be used only as a component of a finite form, its fusing with the suffix of the perfect participle (and the imperfect converb) brought into being the verbal forms which serve as predicates of a simple sentence or a principal clause of a complex sentence.
  In Literary Manchu the copula bi and the participial suffix -ha/ -he/-ho are often written as one, although these are exceptions to this. When the copula bi follows the perfect participle as an independent lexical unit we are dealing with the analytical form of the past tense. In this case one can notice the living relationship between the developing verbal form of the past tense in -habi/-hebi/-hobi and the older analytical form expressed by the construction “the perfect participle + the copula bi.” The copula bi may be replaced by the copula kai which is sometimes written separately from the verb. Thus, instead of the form alahabi the combination alaha kai occurs.
  As finite forms, both the imperfect in -mbi and perfect in -habi/ -hebi/-hobi, are used in the predicate position. When the autonomous component for one of them is expressed by the converb and for the other by the participle, we have every reason to claim that non-finite forms are the oldest in Manchu and that the forms of the indicative mood have developed from converbs and participles.

Stative converb: |
  Stative converb: the converbal form in -hai/-hei/-hoi or -kai/-kei/-koi is used to denote action that is durative and intermittent (for a long time, continually, constantly, permanently); frequentative (often, many times, again and again, repeatedly); or intensive (intently, persistently, steadily). Here are some examples: alahai “telling many times;” jonkoi “reminding again and again, constantly;” tehei aliyambi “someone waits sitting for a long time.” Presumably, this form originated from the perfect participle followed by the marker of the genitive case: -hai/ -hei/-hoi < -ha/-he/-ho + i = GEN. Serving as an adverb of manner in a sentence, the perfect participle was regularly followed by the suffix for the genitive. Gradually, adverbial meaning was assigned to this participial form which shifted its category status from participles to converbs. The newly formed converb preserved the perfective meaning by which the perfect participle was characterized but it gained an additional meaning of duration:
  yasa hada-hai tuwa-mbi
  eye fix.the.eyes.on-CONV look.at-IMPF “(Someone) stares at (smth./smb.) intently” (ZAKH:194); ere bayan n’alma (ma. niyalma) jui tere muke be daha-me this rich man child that river ACC follow-CONV yabu-hai muke i sekin (ma. sekiyen) de ixina-ha (ma. isina-ha) go-CONV river GEN origin DAT reach-PART “That rich man’s son having gone along the river for a long time, reached the source” (SK:76).
  The syntactic construction formed by the imperfect and perfect participles in the genitive followed by the word teile “just,” “only,” “alone” is noted by some authors. The meaning of this construction is rendered as “to the extent of ... ”: mutere-i teile “with all one can,” “with all one’s capabilities,” “to extent of one’s power;” jabduha-i teile “as time permits,” “as opportunity allows”. 
  There are also constructions formed by repeatition of the same stem, where the first component is represented by the perfect participle and the second by the converb: baha bahai “unintentionally” (baha-“to get,” “to obtain”); nambuha nambuhai “at random,” “by chance,” “unintentionally” (nambu-“to catch,” “to have fall into one’s hand”) (Zakharov, 1879:194; NL:22, 209). To substitute meanings that are rendered by this converb, the words emdubei “continually,” “persistently,” “steadily,” “frequently,” “earnestly” and daruhai “often,” “continually,” “regularly” are often used.

Negative Participle Forms: |
  Negative Participle Forms The negative participle is formed by the particle akv which also serves for the negation of the presence of an object or its quality. However, there is formal difference between negative forms of participles and nouns. In the structure of the negative participle the concretion between the participial suffix and the negative particle occurred whereas with nouns the negative particle akv is used as a separate word. 
  Presumably, in the past the negative particle was used with the participle as a separate word too. In Radlov’s records of Sibe, the negative particle is often written separately from the participle, for example: bure akv “(someone) does not give (smth.),” ulhibuke akv “(someone) did not give to know.” It can be conjectured that the negative particle akv preserves its lexical independence when it logically emphasized (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:68). Usually the particle akv is not governed by the law of vowel harmony. However, in classical Manchu in most cases the particle akv is fully fused with the participle into one word: arahakv < araha + akv (ara-“to do,” “to make”); generakv < genere + akv, genehakv < genehe + akv (gene-“to go”); henduhekv < henduhe + akv (hendu-“to say,” “to speak”); ohakv < oho + akv (o-“to become”); sarakv < sara + akv (sa-“to know”), etc.
  Some perfect participles terminating in -ka/-ke/-ko change the consonant k into h in their negative form: jongko + akv > jongkakv/jonghakv (jo-“to recall,” “to mention”); soyoko + akv > soyohakv (soyo-“to shrink,” “to wrinkle”); talmaka + akv > talmahakv (talma-“to be foggy”); tucike + akv > tucihekv (tuci-“to appear,” “to emerge,” “to originate from”). In complex participial forms which are formed by perfect participles derived from autonomous verbal stems and by those derived from auxiliary verbal stems, the negative particle akv is fused with the first component: alahakv bihe, genehakv bihe.
  Instead of an affirmative utterance the Manchus widely used a so-called double negation where the first negative particle is written together with the participles and the second one occurs separately after them: arahakv akv, genehakv akv, sarakv akv (Zakharov, 1879:213-4).
  The negative particle unde “not yet” is normally used after the imperfect participle even when it denotes an action performed in the past: jidere unde “(someone) has not come yet.” Here is a sentence which includes the negative particle “unde:”
  
  Only the participle is characterized by the opposition between positive and negative forms. Neither verbs nor converbs have negative forms. Therefore, in cases when the negative form of the verb or the converb is required, the negative participle is used.
  
  Negative participles may serve as any part of a sentence, however, they are mostly used as a predicate of a sentence since they may replace the forms of the verb proper. 
  
  The adverbialization of negative participles frequently occurs due to the fact that negative participles often function as adverbs in a sentence:
  muke inengdari (ma. inenggidari) lakcarakv eye-mbi water every.day uninterruptedly flow-IMPF lakcarakv “uninterruptedly” < lakca-ra akv (lakca-“to break off”) “Water every day will flow uninterruptedly” (SK). The fact that verbs and converbs have no negative forms is additional evidence for the late formation of verbs proper and converbs as compared with the participle.

Substantive Forms of Participles: |
  In the Manchu language the substantive-possessive suffix -ngge which may be attached to both participles, perfect and imperfect (forms in -ha/-he/-ho and -ra/-re/-ro respectively) and to the negative forms of these participles. This suffix does not change its vowel according to the law of vowel harmony. Normally it is written together with participles.
  As mentioned above, from the diachronic point of view, the suffix -ngge was related to the meaning of possession (see Section 2.4.1).
  Following a single participle or a subordinate predicative construction with a participle as a head, the suffix -ngge permits both of them to play the part of a subject or an object in a sentence. I shall use the term “nominalization” to designate the process by which a word of any grammatical class may act (and the result of this acting) in the noun position (see also Section 2.4.1). From the synchronic point of view, the suffix -ngge can rightfully be called a nominalizer.
  The nominalization of participles (and the subsequent process which is substantivization, i.e. the shift of a word to the grammatical class of substantives) has developed in several directions. Participles followed by the suffix -ngge may denote: 1) an abstract notion about an action and can be translated as abstract substantives: aliburangge “presentation of a document to a superior;” bairengge “an application submitted to a superior” or 2) an object which, in its turn, may be of material or immaterial nature: minde buhengge “what was given to me,” “present,” “what you have done,” “a deed,” 3) a subject: “one who says, thinks, etc.,” “those who say, think, etc.”
  Not only affirmative participial forms in -ngge but also their negative
  forms may be characterized by these meanings: akdarakvngge “distrust,” “one who does not trust;” saburakvngge “what is not seen,” “never seen before.”
  In certain cases, participles followed by the suffix -ngge may denote both an abstract action and a person who is characterized according to the action he performs. The difference between these meanings can be understood only from the syntactic context:
  
  A participle construction with a participle as a head, may contain its own subject expressed by a noun in the genitive case:
  
  The absence of any case markers after participles in the form in -ngge denotes the nominative which normally marks a subject. The marker of the accusative, added to participles, marks an object:
  
  Direct speech, quotations, hearsay are often introduced with participles in -ngge. In this function participles derived from vebs of speech are mostly used: ala-ra-ngge (ala-“to say,” “to tell”), hendu-re-ngge (hendu-“speak,” “to talk”), se-re-ngge (se-“to say”), fonji-re-ngge (fonji-“to ask”), wesimbu-re-ngge (wesimbu-“to report”). Participles in the form in -ngge are placed before direct speech:
  
  In the Sibe dialect investigated by Norman, the suffix -nge (-ngge in Manchu) is used as a perfect finite form. This function is common for sentences which express time or place semantics.
  
Desiderative: |
  The suffix for the synthetic form of the desiderative/optative is -ki. This form indicates an action which the person speaking has a desire or an intention to perform or to be performed: bi geneki “I will go” (with the shade of affirmation), si geneki “you would go” (not in the meaning of a strong order but in the meaning of a desire), i geneki “let him/ she go.” Since the optative denotes actions which are not realized, which are to take place in the future, it is inevitably related to the expression of the future. However, the relationship of the optative with the future is a secondary feature which results from the modal nature of this form. That is why the optative forms are often used to indicate the future, and the form in -ki is considered by most specialists as one which denotes the future indicative. When the optative is referred to the second and the third persons (singular and plural) its meaning is very close to that of the imperative. There is a structural reason against analyzing the optative forms for the second and the third persons as the imperative. These forms would become separated from the form for the first person, and the paradigm of the optative would disintegrate. The imperative meaning of the optative occurs only in specific grammatical conditions when reference is made to the second and the third persons. In such cases the imperative meaning arises as additional and secondary to the meaning of the optative. The optative does not possess the category of tense. 

Optative: |
  The form in -kini is used to address a person who is lower in social position. It denotes an order to perform an action immediately: alakini “let him speak” or “allow him to speak;” gaikini “let him take” or “allow him to take;” genekini “let him go” or “allow him to go.” Here are some examples:
  
  According to Zakharov, the form in -kini consists of the suffix of the optative -ki and the interrogative particle ni. It is used in respect to the second or the third persons in order to cause the addressee to act or fulfil a command immediately.
  
  According to Lebedeva, the form in -kini is used when the person addressed is to cause another person (persons) to perform an action: okini “order him (or them) to become,” gajikini “order him (them) to
  bring.” In her opinion, the suffix -kini consists of two components. The first is represented by the marker of the optative in -ki, and the second component ni indicates the third person. It originated, as in other languages of the Tungus-Manchu family, from the pronoun of the third person in the genetive: i “he” + (n)i > ini.
  
Aorist: |
  This suffix is attached directly to a verbal stem. Zakharov believed that the suffix -mbi is a result of the combination of two elements,
  i.e. the suffix of the imperfect converb -me and the copula bi: -mbi < -me + bi (Zakharov, 1879:173).
  It should be mentioned that there are different opinions about the meaning of this form, and no one is universally accepted. According to some manchurologists, the suffix -mbi is used to express the present tense (Zakharov, 1879:173; Möllendorff, 1892:9). The others consider that the form in -mbi is used to indicate both the present and future therefore it can rightfully be called the form of the present-future tense (Lebedeva & Gorelova, 1994:78). There is an opinion according to which the suffix -mbi is defined as a marker for the aorist, an aspectual-temporal category (Haenisch, 1986:51). D. Sinor considers that the -mbi marker is indefinite. In his opinion, -mbi does not represent the action in time and does not indicate whether the action is accomplished or not (Sinor, 1968:268-9). According to the most widespread point of view, the form in -mbi is considered to be an imperfect finite form (Norman, 1974:168-9). I will refer to this form as the imperfect finite form. 
  The imperfect form has the following grammatical meanings:
  a) it is used to indicate usual and frequentative or abstract actions. This meaning is close to that of the generic time.
  b) it is used to denote a concrete action which is synchronous to the moment of speech
  c) the form in -mbi is used to indicate the future tense:
  d) there are some instances when the form in -mbi indicates such action which has been completed prior to the moment of speech and consequences related to this are relevant to the present moment:
  
  Sometimes the form in -mbi occurs in a subordinate clause when dependence between two events (situations) of the outside world is expressed analytically, by converbal or participial forms of the verb se-“to say” in its auxiliary finction (seme, seci “in order”): 
      
Durative hypothetical imperfect tense: |
  The form in -mbihe is used to indicate actions which took place in the past.
  Some specialists specify this tense as the past indefinite: alambihe “(one) told,” genembihe “(one) went;” obombihe “(one) washed”
  Others consider this tense to be the
  past continuous: arambihe “(one) was writing” (Mollendorff, 1892:10).
  Zakharov suggests that this form originated from the imperfect converb in -me derived from an autonomous verb and the perfect participle derived from the verb bi-: -mbihe < -me + bihe. He lists several verb forms: alambihe < alame bihe; genembihe < geneme bihe; obombihe < obome bihe (Zakharov, 1879:174). 

Durative simultaneous converb: |
  The imperfect converb is frequently used in combination with different forms of the verb bi-“to be” in its auxiliary function. 
  The functions of such newly created analytical forms require more detailed study, however, we know that they have aspectual-temporal meaning in the first place, as in: ala-me bi-me “telling;” banji-me bi-he “having lived long;” gene-me bi-he “having gone.” 
  The form of the imperfect converb may be fused with grammatical forms of the verb bi- in its auxiliary function, for example: alambime (< ala-me bi-me) “telling;” alambihe (< ala-me bi-he) “having said;” bahambihe (< baha-me bi-he) “having found;” wambihe (< wa-me bi-he) “having killed;” gasambihe (< gasa-me bi-he) “having grieved.” 
  In connection with such forms it should be mentioned that some of them are considered independent converbs, for example, the form in -mbime (Zakharov, 1879:191).

Imperfect converb: |
  Being one of the most commonly used forms in Manchu, the imperfect converb realizes a wide and diverse range of functions. The main meaning of the imperfect converb the suffix for which is -me, is that of simultaneity of both dependent and principal actions. In other words, the converb of this type, as a dependent (non-finite) form, denotes relative tense which, as known, is not related to the moment of speaking but to the tense of the finite form.
  The temporal characteristics of dependent action expressed by the imperfect converb are transmitted to this action from the finite form and from the tense characteristics it possesses. Thus, simultaneity may occur in the past, present, and future.
  Empirical material connected with the functioning of the imperfect converb proves that the hypothesis of broader semantics of simple forms is correct. Thus, the simpler the form is structurally, the more developed system of functions it has (Shamina, 1985:5).
  On the basis of its main meaning, that of simultaneity of both subordinate and principal actions, the imperfect converb develops a wide range of other adverbial meanings, firstly meanings of manner in which another action is performed; condition, cause, and purpose. 
  
  The imperfect converb is commonly used with verbs of motion, phase and modal verbs, and their functions are analogous to those of the Russian infinitive. Here are a few examples of the use of the imperfect
  converb followed by verbs that have semantics of motion. In the following constructions imperfect verbs denote the purpose of an action:
  
  In combination with verbs of broad semantics, like tuci-“to appear,”
  “to go;” gene-“to go,” “to set off;” ji-“to come,” “to arrive;” gai- “to take;” wa-“to kill” and others, imperfect converbs derived from
  verbs of concrete semantics are used to specify actions of broad semantics.
  Here are the combinations of the imperfect converb with various forms of the verb tuci-: uka-me tuci-he ( running away went out > ran away); ana-me tuci-bu-he (pushing let smb. appear > pushed out).
  The following combinations include the imperfect converb with the verb gai-: uda-me gai-ha (buying took > bought); hvlha-me gai-ha (robbing took > robbed).
  The following combinations consist of the imperfect converb with the verb gene-: amca-me gene-he (running down went > reached); dosime gene-he (entering went > entered).
  Here are the combinations of the imperfect converb with various forms of the verb ji-: suju-me jiu (running come > run [here]); mudame ji-he (returning came > returned).
  The following combinations consist of the imperfect converb and the verb wa-: gapta-me wa-ki (shooting kill > shoot), saci-me wa (killing with a sabre kill > kill with a sabre). 
  
  Combination of the imperfect converbs of synonymous verbs is more frequently used to express a higher level of action intensity.

Prefatory converb: |
  The converb in -nggala/-nggele/-nggolo denotes the subordinate action before which the main action takes place. 
  
  This converb, like the others, may be derived from certain verbs in their auxiliary function, chiefly from the verb o-“to be,” “to become:” onggolo “before.” All such forms show a tendency to shift to another grammatical class of words, viz. into conjunctions: isitala “up to,” “until;” onggolo “before;” otolo “until;” oci, seci “if;” ofi “because.”

Imperfect participle: |
  The imperfect participle has the suffix -ra/-re/-ro: gene-re (gene-“to go”); ana-ra (ana-”to push”); taci-re (taci-“to learn,” “to study”). There are two irregular participial forms, bisi-re and ojo-ro. The first participle, bisire, is formed from the existential verb bi-“to be,” “to exist” which in this case is used in the irregular form bisi-. All the other forms of this verb are formed from the stem bi-. The stem bisi- may be analyzed etymologically bearing in mind the Evenki participle bisi in which -si is an ancient participial suffix. The same suffix can be found in the Evenki negative auxiliary participle esi. Thus, the Manchu participle bisire has two participial suffixes, the first of them is the ancient suffix -si, analogous to the Evenki suffix -si, and the second one is the contemporary suffix -re. The participle ojoro is etymologically equal to the Evenki verb ojara the structure of which is transparent. The verb ojara is the form of the present tense of the third person, plural, of the verb o-“to become,” where -ja is an aspectual suffix. Since this suffix does not occur among living derivational elements in Manchu, the participle ojoro has a form different from that of other imperfect participles. There are a few more imperfect participles that have irregular forms: jetere (je-“to eat”), jidere (ji-“to come”). A group of imperfect participles have the combinations of elements n+de inserted between the stem and the suffix -ra/-re/-ro: bandara (ba-“to be tired,” “to be lazy,” “to gnaw a hole”); jendere (je-“to bear,” “to put up with,” “to tolerate”); jondoro (jo-“to bring to mind,” “to recall,” “to mention”). Normally such verbs have irregular forms of perfect participles in -ngka/-ngke/-ngko. 
  According to Iv. Zakharov, some verbs have two forms for the imperfect participles, in -ra/-re/-ro and -ndara/-ndere/-ndoro. The latter form denotes progression of the action: akjara “thundering,” akjandara “gradually breaking out in thunder” (akja-“to thunder”); sakdara “ageing,” sakdandara “gradually approaching old age” (sakda-“to get old,” “to age”); were “melting,” wendere “gradually approaching the melted condition” (we-“to melt”) (Zakharov, 1879:186).
  In the out-of-case form the imperfect participle is usually used as an attribute or a predicate
  
  The Manchu participles may be followed by markers of the oblique cases when they function as predicates of clauses or objects and adverbial modifiers, either independently or together with dependent words.
  Participles are often used in the dative. The imperfect participles followed by the dative have the meaning of an action which takes place during the time another action is performed or is a result of the completion of that action. 
  
  The accusative is the second most commonly used marker participles may be followed by. Participles in the accusative usually serve as direct objects which have the meaning of an action or a person who is characterized according to the action he performs
  
  Participles in other oblique cases are rarely found. They may be used with marker for the ablative and genitive
  
Temeritive apprehensive converb: |
  The analytical form, which consists of the negative form of the imperfect participle in -rahv (-rahv < -ra + akv) and a grammatical form of the verb se-“to say” in its auxiliary function, normally denotes the meaning of apprehension that an action might take place contrary to a desire or expectation. This meaning is very close to that expressed by the following patterns including connecting devices: “(in order) not to do + inf.;” “(so) that ... may not (might) + inf.;” “in order that ... may not (might) + inf.;” “I am afraid that.” The composite morpheme -rahv may be replaced with the participial suffix -ra, but the meaning of the whole analytical form does not change: alarahv sembi, alara sembi “(I) am afraid that (he) might tell.” Sometimes the negative form of the imperfect participle in -rakv in combination with a form of the verb se- are used to produce the same meaning. Here are some examples which express the meaning “anxious expectation:”
  
  In negative sentences with the functional verb o-, the negative particle
  akv is attached to a participial form of an autonomous verb, whereas
  the morpheme -hv (< akv) occurs with grammatical forms of the verb
  o-in its auxiliary function.

adverbials: |
  In Manchu there is another converb formed by the suffix -tai/-tei/-toi, 
  when attached to a verbal stem, this suffix denotes an extreme degree of an action.

Terminative converb: |
  The terminative/terminal converb in -tala/-tele/-tolo indicates such subordinate action which is going on simultaneously with the principal action. The latter continues until the final completion of the dependent action. Therefore, completion of the subordinate action is that terminal limit up to which the principal action is leading: ala-tala “until telling;” gene-tele “until going;” mana-tala “until full completion,” “until an end” (mana-“to come to an end,” “to diminish”); sakda-tala “till old age, until old.” Here are some examples:
  
  The terminal converb is not used very often in classical Manchu and can be considered an old form. Its use is mainly limited to the syntactic words isitala “up to,” “until” and otolo “till,” “until,” which were originally converbs formed from verbs isi-“to reach,” “to come to,” “to arrive” and o-“to be,” “to become.”
